Review</I></B></FONT></P>

<P>(Fade into a distant shot of a tropical island at sunset.)</P>

<P><B>Mike Quinn</B>: (voice over, as the shot starts to zoom in) A
tropical island, filled to the brim with mysteries and intrigue. Can a
group of anonymous and hastily made up people with little to no personality
that were only created as a gimmicky way to abstractly represent episodes
of a popular animated cable television series survive there? I don't really
care, either, but we're about to find out on <I>Daria Episode
Survivor</I>!</P>

<P>(Cut to a shot of each "contestant" in front of some random
island backdrop - each is wearing a shirt with the appropriate number and
each has a serious expression on his or her face.)</P>

<P><B>#1</B>: I am number one, Katherine. I'm all business and I love to
create conflict and tension.</P>

<P>(Cut to #2.)</P>

<P><B>#2</B>: I am Mega, number two. I am the less interesting cousin of a
contestant from a previous season of this show.</P>

<P>(Cut to #3.)</P>

<P><B>#3</B>: My name is Velma, I am number three. <I>I</I> don't even know
what to make of myself.</P>

<P>(Cut to #4.)</P>

<P><B>#4</B>: Number four is me, I am Muddy. Not a whole lot of it, if you
really must know what, is about how much sense I make.</P>

<P>(Cut to #5.)</P>

<P><B>#5</B>: I am number five, Oprah. (yawn) I'm fairly boring and
predictable.</P>

<P>(Cut to #6.)</P>

<P><B>#6</B>: I am Leo, number six. I may be destined for greatness.</P>

<P>(Cut to #7.)</P>

<P><B>#7</B>: I'm Jerry, number seven. I might have gotten lost in the
shuffle, but I don't suck.</P>

<P>(Cut to #8.)</P>

<P><B>#8</B>: I am number eight, Sigmund. I am insightful.</P>

<P>(Cut to #9.)</P>

<P><B>#9</B>: I am Marty, number nine. What is my point?</P>

<P>(Cut to #10.)</P>

<P><B>#10</B>: I am numero ten, Molly. Not quite legendary, but I am a
funny gal.</P>

<P>(Cut to #11.)</P>

<P><B>#11</B>: Eleven is my number, Gabe is my name. I really need a
miracle.</P>

<P>(Cut to #12.)</P>

<P><B>#12</B>: I am Freddy, number twelve. I'm a complex bundle of emotion
and deceit.</P>

<P>(Cut to #13.)</P>

<P><B>#13</B>: I am Di, number thirteen. I am Freddy's younger and maybe
even more complex twin sister.</P>

<P>(Fade into a shot of a tropical beach.)</P>

<P><B>Mike Quinn</B>: (voice over) There you have it, the field is set. Who
will survive? To help us find out, here is your host Daria
Morgendorffer.</P>

<P>(Cut to the "tribal council" area, the "contestants"
are all seated as Daria enters to address them.)</P>

<P><B>Daria</B>: (to the contestants; reading first part off an index card)
Hello everyone, welcome to the island. (They all murmur
"Thanks.") In case you weren't paying attention while the
producers talked to you before the show, here are the rules. I'm going to
make you guys do crazy stunts and then kick you off without necessarily
taking into account the outcomes of those stunts. So, don't make me mad and
you might have a chance. Any questions?</P>

<P><B>Oprah, #5</B>: Yeah, doesn't that seem a little unfair?</P>

<P><B>Daria</B>: As a matter of fact, it does. But they've already decided
who's going to win (Bt; looks at another index card) and you didn't. Please
leave now. </P>

<P><B>Oprah, #5</B>: Wha...?</P>

<P><B>Marty, #9</B>: Hey, she didn't even do anything!</P>

<P><B>Daria</B>: I know, but I <I>am</I> the host and as far as any of you
are concerned, I'm the queen of the island. (Bt) By the way, you can go
with her, you didn't win either. Neither one of you really ever deserved to
be considered
the best of this group anyway.</P>

<P>(Number nine looks like she's going to talk back but doesn't.)</P>

<P><B>Daria</B>: (to the rest of them) Everyone see how that works? (They
all nod.)</P>

<P>(As those two walk off, cut to an office, Mike is sitting in a big
comfortable chair in front of a wall full of books.)</P>

<P><B>Mike Quinn</B>: Hello everyone, now it's time for me to tell you why
#5 and #9 got kicked of first. First let's talk about #5, <I>The F
Word</I>.  Relatively, <I>The F Word</I> just didn't cut it when compared
to most of the rest of the season. Probably the worst "ensemble"
episode in a while (at least it was spared from having the same plot as the
others), the story was destined to fail from the beginning, even Mr.
O'Neill shouldn't be dumb enough to set up the whole class to be miserable.
We did get some delightful moments out of <I>The F Word</I>, though, like
Jane's cheerleading "tryout," but that didn't help the fact that
we all knew where the whole thing was probably going to end up about two
minutes into the assignment. <I>The F Word</I> failed to flunk, but was
fatally flawed by following a flimsy formula to the finish. Now let's get
to #9, <I>Mart of Darkness</I>. Where to begin with this debacle? <I>Mart
of Darkness</I> begs one question; why should I care? The problem was that
no reason to care was ever given. Basically, this episode had all of the
worst problems of season four bound up in one gigantic mess. A mess that
probably could be bought at a bulk store. There was no real direction here,
too many gratuitous references masquerading as continuity and various other
gimmicks that we've seen many times before. We have a product that tried
too hard to do too much but never really got anything done. Not to mention
that it was never really interesting in the first place. I'll be back after
each group of exiles with my comments, so stay tuned. Now back to Daria on
the island.</P>

<P>(Cut back to the island.)</P>

<P><B>Daria</B>: Thanks, Mike. Why didn't you come and host this thing
yourself?</P>

<P><B>Mike Quinn</B>: (v.o.) You're kidding, right?</P>

<P><B>Daria</B>: (shakes her head) Anyway, our first challenge involves
eating. <I>Lots</I> of eating. More specifically, you guys are going to eat
these individually wrapped servings of my mom's lasagna here being prepared
by the tribal chef of the indigenous people of the island that we didn't
know about until we picked this island and disturbed their home in the name
of high ratings. Hey chef!</P>

<P><B>Tribal Chef</B>: Hola. (makes some loud clicking sounds) </P>

<P><B>Gabe, #11</B>: (sort of interrupts) But, there are <I>eight
hundred</I> of them?</P>

<P><B>Daria</B>: That's because you'll be split into two groups, those of
you with even numbers versus those of you with odd numbers. Of course the
odd team will be at a disadvantage.</P>

<P><B>Gabe, #11</B>: Oooh, that's too bad.</P>

<P><B>Daria</B>: You have thirty minutes to eat all four hundred. It
doesn't matter how many each of you eats as long as they're all swallowed
by someone.  The amount that the losing team ate will somehow determine who
gets booted.</P>

<P>(Both teams move to their "dining area," and they start
stuffing the lasagna into their mouths. We pick it up with a few seconds
left and both teams just about ready to heave.)</P>

<P><B>Daria</B>: (looking at her watch) Three... two... one... time's up.
Now let's see how we've done. (close up on one tables) The even team has
twenty of their servings left, while the odd team has eighty-nine left. The
even team wins.</P>

<P>(They kind of sort of cheer a little.)</P>

<P><B>Daria</B>: Now, how can this be used to eliminate some of these
dimwits? (Bt) I know, since the losing team only ate three hundred eleven
servings, number three and number eleven are eliminated. (to #3 and #11)
Bye, now.</P>

<P><B>Gabe, #11</B>: Darn.</P>

<P>(Cut back to Mike in his chair.)</P>

<P><B>Mike Quinn</B>: The next two episodes on our list are <I>A Tree Grows
in Lawndale</I> and <I>Groped by an Angel</I>. First for <I>A Tree Grows in
Lawndale</I>, now here's an episode that is tough to figure out. First, the
entire idea centers on Kevin and Brittany, which usually spells some kind
of trouble. That trouble came in the form of confusion. We move from Kevin
getting hurt to the Fashion Club worrying about the date-ability of the
football team to the cheerleaders trying to conjure up the spirit of Tommy
Sherman. This confusion hurt the episode throughout. The story probably
should have been more focused on Kevin "getting through" his
injury. This, along with the perpetuation of the "Tom is perfect"
stereotype (that, fortunately, got ripped to shreds later in the season),
pushes <I>A Tree Grows in Lawndale</I> towards the bottom. However, as far
as season clunkers go, it wasn't too bad. Now for <I>Groped by an
Angel</I>. It took almost fifty episodes, but <I>Daria</I> finally dealt
with spirituality with <I>Groped by an Angel</I>. However, for the most
part, the issue of the existence of the divine was oversimplified into a
black-and-white issue with Daria taking the "I need proof" route
and Quinn feeling that every good thing that happened to her was due to her
guardian angel. Of course, the point of the episode was to bridge these two
positions, but the way that went was less than smooth, more like forced
(just an aside: polarizing issues like religion, guns, abortion, etc are
things I like to call "no brainers," no one on either extreme
seems to be using them). This is proof to me that <I>Daria</I> shouldn't
focus too much on these types of things.</P>

<P>(Cut back to Daria on the island.)</P>

<P><B>Daria</B>: (looking at an index card that has the next challenge on
it; chuckles) This ought to be good. (Bt) The next challenge is the island
spelling bee. You'll all get one word or phrase and if you spell it
correctly, you get to stay. If you don't, then you leave. No more than
three will be ousted during this challenge. We'll go in numerical order,
expect that I feel like staring with number ten. Molly, number ten, your
phrase to spell is "mythical
promenade."</P>

<P><B>Molly, #10</B>: Uh... m-i-t-h... </P>

<P><B>Daria</B>: Stop right there, genius. You were already wrong, just
want to save you the embarrassment. Bye now. </P>

<P><B>Molly, #10</B>: Uh... OK. </P>

<P>(Cut back to Mike in his chair.)</P>

<P><B>Mike Quinn</B>: <I>Legends of the Mall</I> never tried to be anything
more than it was intended. It was a fun filler episode with a format more
like a <I>Simpson's</I> Halloween episode than an episode of <I>Daria</I>.
We were treated to three "urban legend" type stories about things
that supposedly happened in Lawndale's past. They all had their strong
points (the "Metal Mouth" story was my favorite) but this was an
episode best left unanalyzed.</P>

<P>(Cut back to our intrepid spellers on the island.)</P>

<P><B>Daria</B>: Number one, Katherine, your word is "gripe."</P>

<P><B>Katherine, #1</B>: G-r-i-p-e, gripe.</P>

<P><B>Daria</B>: Good to see we're all not brain-dead here. Mega, number
two, your phrase is "misanthropic ascent." </P>

<P><B>Mega, #2</B>: Can't I get an easier one, like Katherine?</P>

<P><B>Daria</B>: No.</P>

<P><B>Mega, #2</B>: OK, m-i... </P>

<P><B>Daria</B>: Sorry, there's no 'k.' </P>

<P><B>Mega, #2</B>: But...</P>

<P><B>Daria</B>: But nothing, bye now.</P>

<P>(Cut back to Mike in his chair.)</P>

<P><B>Mike Quinn</B>: The first of at least three purely filler episodes,
<I>Antisocial Climbers</I> didn't bring anything new to the table, except
maybe the whole weather thing. Oh, wait, we <I>did</I> have that before
(see <I>Daria!</I>).  Anyway, as I've said a gazillion times before, this
plot has been done to death. The students go to some disastrous school
event/field trip, a couple of funny things happen, no one learns anything
and someone gets stuck somewhere at the end (usually some variation of
Kevin and Brittany, but it was Sandi once).  Not bad strictly on its own
merits, but the fact that we've seen the same episode, with some slight
tweaking, at least three times before didn't help at all.</P>

<P>(Cut back to the fun on the island.)</P>

<P><B>Daria</B>: Muddy, number four, your word is "dream."</P>

<P><B>Muddy, #4</B>: D-r-e-a-m.</P>

<P><B>Daria</B>: Good, number six your spelling assignment is
"march."</P>

<P><B>Leo, #6</B>: M-a-r-c-h.</P>

<P><B>Daria</B>: Great, now number seven, your phrase is "oedipal
complex."</P>

<P><B>Jerry, #7</B>: O-e-d-i-p-a-l space c-o-m-p-l-e- (Bt) c-k-s?</P>

<P><B>Daria</B>: I can't believe you got <I>that</I> part wrong, bye now.
Well, at least that brings this spelling bee to a close now that three of
you have goofed up. Now let's take it back to the studio, where I'm sure
there aren't nearly as many carnivorous insects, for some more
commentary.</P>

<P>(Cut, once again, to Mike in his chair.)</P>

<P><B>Mike Quinn</B>: Actually, there are no bugs in here at all. Ah, the
beauty of the climate controlled studio. <I>Of Human Bonding</I> is
probably the neglected, or at least forgotten, child of season four, being
sandwiched between <I>I Loathe a Parade</I> and <I>Psycho Therapy</I> (not
to mention the midseason "drought").  However, <I>Of Human
Bonding</I> didn't go entirely unnoticed, even though the <I>I Loathe a
Parade</I> talk continued well into the second half of the season. It was a
fairly decent Jake episode and was the first to focus mainly on Daria's
relationship with her dad. They have almost bridged the gap, and hopefully
this will be developed more in season five. While only slightly above
average, <I>Of Human Bonding</I> is nevertheless a fairly strong season
four outing.</P>

<P>(Cut back to the start of the next challenge.)</P>

<P><B>Daria</B>: Now that were more than halfway to crowning a champion and
only six of you remain, it is time to make things difficult. See that rock
formation over there (she points and then pan to some jagged rocks)?  It is
approximately twenty feet high. Each of you will have five minutes to climb
as high as you can, the person that stays the nearest to the bottom will
somehow determine the next two people that get kicked off.</P>

<P>(Highlights of each person's attempt are shown.)</P>

<P><B>Daria</B>: Now that that piece of thought provoking discourse is
over, it's time to figure out who goes. (Bt) Muddy, you only got a quarter
of the way up the cliff. One quarter, (Bt) I've got it, one over four is a
quarter, so numbers four and one can get lost. Bye now.</P>

<P><B>Katherine, #1</B>: That's not fair, I got all the way to the top!</P>

<P><B>Muddy, #4</B>: I'm going to put a beating on someone!</P>

<P><B>Daria</B>: Great, take it up with the guy back in the studio.</P>

<P>(Cut, once again, to Mike in his chair.)</P>

<P><B>Mike Quinn</B>: The original review for <I>Murder, She Snored</I> was
probably the most controversial of the whole season. Here we have this
fantastical episode, and it gets a good grade. How can that be? Well, for
the specific reasons, you all can go back to the original review, but let's
just say that it did all of the things that <I>Depth Takes a Holiday</I>
probably should have. Daria's dream <I>did</I> give us a glimpse into
thought processes regarding her life. Finally, the pop culture references
didn't really help or hurt. So, I guess I liked MSS as a matter of
principle, and I've probably overrated it as a result, but I can live with
that. </P>

<P><B>Muddy, #4</B>: (rumbles in) Hey, why'd you kick me off like that?</P>

<P><B>Mike Quinn</B>: This is my show remember, I can do that if I want.</P>

<P><B>Muddy, #4</B>: I don't care!  I should have won! (he rushes toward
Mike)</P>

<P><B>Mike Quinn</B>: No you shouldn't have. (Mike gives him the Vulcan
neck pinch and Muddy falls to the ground) <I>Partner's Complaint</I> is, in
many ways, the prototypical <I>Daria</I> episode. All of the tension and
angst is there. Daria and Jane didn't get along. Jodie fought with Daria
about using her father's name to help move along their economics project.
Kevin paid cash for a car. Cash! But, overall, other than starting the
early season "Daria sold out" storm, which, I think was a little
overblown, and barring a few over-the-top scenes (like almost everything
involving Wally or the car dealer), this was a good episode. It was mostly
meat with not a lot of filler.</P>

<P>(Cut back to the start of the next challenge.)</P>

<P><B>Daria</B>: (looking at another index card) Let's see what it says on
the card, uh, this is weird, it says "Daria, I'm just about out of
ideas and I want to save the one I have left for the finale, so just make
something up. Be sure to get rid of two of them." Signed,
"Mike." (rolls eyes) OK, here we go, (Bt) I guess I'll exercise
my absolute powers as queen of the island and get rid of (Bt; ponders her
predicament with a hand on her chin) the twins. Twins have always creeped
me out. Bye now.</P>

<P><B>Freddy, #12</B>: Oh well...</P>

<P><B>Di, #13</B>: (to Freddy) I guess we just have to get back our usual
task of solving mysteries.</P>

<P><B>Freddy, #12</B>: Yeah. And we didn't have to compete with each other.</P>

<P><B>Daria</B>: See what I mean. Anyway, we'll decide the
"champion" after this. Will it be Leo, number six, or Sigmund,
number eight? Simply thrilling.</P>

<P>(Back to the studio)</P>

<P><B>Mike Quinn</B>: Boy it's really heating up, we will get right back to
the final event after these comments on our last two exiles <I>Fire!</I> is
the start of the mini-arc that ends up with Tom trading in his original
girlfriend for her best friend. Jane and Tom's difficulties finally started
to show, when she accused Daria of "monopolizing his time." At
this point in the story, Daria is still caught in the middle, more than
anything. Her best friend's boyfriend is suddenly showing interest in her.
That would be a tough situation for anyone. Anyway, by itself (without all
the context), <I>Fire!</I> isn't that special, but as part of the whole
story, it's a strong beginning. <I>Dye! Dye! My Darling</I> We can't talk
about <I>Fire!</I> without also mentioning <I>Dye! Dye! My Darling</I>,
which is part two of the story. Not exactly a "cliffhanger"
ending, <I>Dye!Dye! My Darling</I> set the stage for <I>Is It Fall Yet?</I>
The major movement of the episode was the stress on Daria and Jane's
friendship caused by Tom's shifting loyalties. And then there was the kiss!
Love it or hate it, you won't forget it. This installment of the "love
triangle trilogy" built nicely upon the first part and was much more
suspenseful.  Kudos to the staff of the show for pulling off this plotline
without letting the whole thing degenerate into soap opera crap. </P>

<P> (Cut back to the tribal council setting for the final event.)  </P>

<P><B>Daria</B>: Welcome back to the island for our final event. Leo and
Sigmund are the only islanders left. How do you guys feel about this last
event?  </P>

<P><B>Leo, #6</B>: Well, I don't know you haven't told us what it is yet.  </P>

<P><B>Sigmund, #8</B>: Yeah. (Bt) By the way, what exactly is the prize for
winning this thing, anyway?  </P>

<P><B>Daria</B>: An all-expenses-paid trip to a tropical island.  </P>

<P><B>Sigmund, #8</B> : Sounds good.  </P>

<P><B>Leo, #6</B>: But didn't we already get that?  </P>

<P><B>Daria</B>: If you say so. The final event is the jungle obstacle
course. You will race against each other through five obstacles. (each
obstacle is shown while it is described) The first obstacle each of you
will have to climb a tree and make a treacherous high wire trip across to
another tree using only a pair of ropes. (Bt) Second, you must trek across
a wooden suspension bridge. Be careful, some of the planks are loose. (Bt)
For the next task, you will have to climb to the top of a cliff and jump
twenty-five feet into a lake below. (Bt) After swimming to shore, you must
negotiate a series of
hurdles. (Bt) And finally, you must each race one hundred yards to the
finish line.  </P>

<P><B>Leo, #6</B>: Let's go!  </P>

<P><B>Daria</B>:Are you now both ready for this pointless display of
reality television? (they both nod as Daria notices something off camera)
What?</P>

<P> (A guy, presumably the director, comes up to Daria and whispers
something in her ear.)  </P>

<P><B>Daria</B>: Really? How embarrassing. (Bt) What should we do?  (more
whispers) OK, (Bt; to the contestants) apparently, we've run out of time.
There's not enough time for the obstacle course, so, we're going to decide
the winner by a simple flip of the coin. (she takes out a coin) Heads, Leo
wins; tails, Sigmund wins.  </P>

<P> (Daria flips the coin. It flies end over end and in slow motion and as it
is about to hit the ground, we cut back to the studio.)  </P>

<P><B>Mike Quinn</B>: Thrilling, isn't it? In case you're all wondering, I
can't really decide which episode was the best of the year. Was it <I>Psycho
Therapy</I> or <I>I Loathe a Parade</I>?  I'm not sure, they're <I>both</I> good.  One of the few standout episodes
of the season, <I>Psycho Therapy</I> was a strong character driven episode.
All of the Morgendorffer's foibles came out. Helen and Jake's communication
problems are finally tackled. Daria does her best to "see
through" the whole retreat thing through some self-diagnosis (and also
a little ogling of Tom's butt). In the end, everyone realized they like the
way things are, which I guess is a minor disappointment, but the only one.
This is one of the best of the season. It's hard to write about the good
ones. <I>I Loathe a Parade</I> was the episode that started a lot. It set
up much of what happened at the end of the
season and the movie. The main premise was the misadventures of Daria and
Tom while looking for Jane during the homecoming parade. Of course, Tom got
his task done and got Daria to stop being hostile towards him, while Daria
learned that he's not necessarily the enemy. As I said earlier, almost
every scene of <I>I Loathe a Parade</I> has some relevance; there was
nearly no wasted time. <I>I Loathe a Parade</I> might not be at its
strongest as a stand-alone episode, but in the correct context, we're
talking "instant classic" here. Now back to the island.  </P>

<P> (Cut back to the island, where the coin has hit the ground... on its
edge.)  </P>

<P><B>Daria</B>: Oh great, it's heads <I>and</I> tails, you both win. (Bt) For your fabulous
prize, all you have to do is enter that island hut over there.  </P>

<P>(She points to a previously unseen grass hut as both Leo and Sigmund walk toward
it. Cut to the inside as they enter.)  </P>

<P>(Torches line a pathway down the center of the room.  At the end of
the path, we
see a shadowy figure seated in a chair which towers high above the winners,
almost
reaching the ceiling.  Nervous, both Sigmund and Leo fall to their knees.)</P>

<P><b>Figure</b>: (mysterious)  Greetings: I am She Who Sees All and Knows
All.  I can
tell you with
certainty what the future holds.</P>

<P><b>Sigmund, #8</b>: (awed)  And what does it hold, O Mysterious One??</P>

<P><b>Figure</b>:  All shall be revealed shortly, my Psychological One.</P>

<P><b>Leo, #6</b>:  Do <i>you</i> give us our prize?</P>

<P><b>Figure</b>:  Indeed I shall.  But first --</P>

<P><b>Sigmund, #8</b>: (with recognition)  Wait a minute: I <i>know</i> that
voice.</P>

<P><b>Figure</b>: (chuckles)  Don't be absurd.  My voice is unknowable.</P>

<P><b>Leo, #6</b>: (also with recognition)  I do, too.  (squints)  Hey, aren't
you that
fanfic author
who gave the predictions last year?  Carrie D. Wildly?</P>

<P><b>Sigmund, #8</b>: (correcting)  Kara Wild.</P>

<P><b>Figure</b>: (nervous)  Um... no.  Don't be --</P>

<P><b>Sigmund, #8</b>:  Weren't you the one who said Tom Sloane wouldn't play a
very big
role in
Season Four?  That (clears his throat) he would appear in maybe <i>four</i>
episodes max??</P>

<P><b>Leo, #6</b>: (proud)  I'm living proof of the fallacy of <i>that</i>
statement.</P>

<P><b>Figure</b>: (sputtering)  All right, all right, I <i>am</i> the
person of
whom you speak, okay??
Dammit, just give me a chance to redeem myself.  A lot of my other
predictions came true --</P>
<ul>
<li>Mack and Andrea speaking more than usual</li>
<li>Quinn finally challenging Sandi in her own way</li>
<li>Quinn developing a crush on a guy</li>
<li>Helen and Jake having a blow-up</li>
<li>Daria being less interested in Trent romantically</li>
</ul>



<P><b>Sigmund, #8</b>:  Yeah, but you blew the Tom one.</P>

<P><b>Leo, #6</b>:  Big time.</P>

<P><b>Wild</b>: (sweating a little)  I just <i>said</i> he wouldn't appear
every other
epi --</P>

<P><b>Sigmund, #8</b>:  That seat getting a little hot for you?</P>

<P><b>Wild</b>: (glaring)  Look, if you don't let me give this season's
predictions,
I'll start plugging
my fanfiction to the audience.</P>

<P>(Leo and Sigmund's eyes widen with alarm.)</P>

<P><b>Leo, #6</b>:  NO!</P>

<P><b>Sigmund, #8</b>:  What is <i>with</i> fanfic authors and your constant
need to
plug your work??</P>

<P><b>Wild</b>: (satisfied)  All right, then.  (Bt)  First, all genuine
predictions
that didn't come
true last year -- Daria and Quinn get a car, Aunt Amy makes a prominent
appearance, the "sex"
episode, and the flashback episode -- will be hold-overs for this
season.</P>

<P>Now for my new predictions.  Members of fandom may recognize their
own speculations amongst the ones listed.</P>
<ul>
<li>Because we haven't seen a true funeral episode ("The Misery Chick"
included), there will be
one this season.  The deceased will probably be Helen's mother, which will
lead to an insightful
look into mother/daughter relationships.  And we will finally hear the name
"Barksdale" spoken
aloud, BUT still won't know if Helen is the oldest or how many years younger
Amy is.</li>
 
<li>Family support seemed to be a strong underlying theme in "Is It Fall
Yet?", particularly
when Tom says that Jane (paraphrasing) "could be a Ph.D or be painting tiles
and
her parents wouldn't care either way."  I predict that Jane's parents' lack
of involvement
will become an issue in Season Five.  Thus, look for another appearance by
Vincent and Amanda
Lane.  Look for Amanda to butt heads with Helen.  And look for Jane's dad's
name to be spoken
aloud for the first time.</li>
<br>
<li>Stacy will FINALLY stand up to Sandi, probably in the last episode.
It's going to happen
because it's destiny, like Quinn standing up to Sandi.  And because of that,
Sandi will finally
show a moment of vulnerability.</li>
<br>
<li>Daria and Jodie are going to butt heads, as it's revealed both have a
shot at becoming
valedictorian.  Jodie will care more than Daria, but Jodie will make Daria
angry by insinuating
that Daria deserves it less because she isn't as involved with school.</li>
<br>
<li>Now that Quinn is less shallow, she will finally apologize to the 3 J's
for the way she's
treated them.  She'll do it in an offhand way, leaving the 3 J's so stunned,
they won't
know how to react.  Then it will be business as usual.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<P>Now for some Tom-related predictions:</P>
<ul>
<li>Yes, Jane <i>will</i> have lingering doubts about Daria dating her
ex.  More to
the point, she'll be feeling a little neglected, and seek to fill the void
by spending
more time with Daria's family.  I predict this will lead her to start
calling Daria's parents by their first names.</li>
<br>
<li>Quinn will <i>not</i> become friends with Elsie Sloane.  No matter
what's been speculated,
I just don't think they'd fit together.  (Pause)  Of course, if I say that,
it probably means
they <i>will</i> become friends.</li>
<br>
<li>I'm tempted to say that Daria and Tom will break up at the end of the
season, but that
may simply be due to my lingering shock that they're together in the first
place.  Thus,
I'll hold off.  But those who never warmed to Tom, take heart: maybe
because I said they
<i>won't</i> break up, they will.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<P>And now for some "It'd be amazing if it DID happen" predictions:</P>
<ul>
<li>We will never find out if Andrea's last name is "Hecuba" (as is widely
rumored)</li>
<br>
<li>Upchuck will never get any</li>
<br>
<li>We will never see a math teacher</li>
<br>
<li>Helen will never have an affair with Eric.  At least... not one that
will be revealed.</li>
<br>
<li>And Kevin and Brittany will never go away.  Never, NEVER!  We're stuck
with them, <i>dammit</i>!</li>
</ul>
<br>
<P><b>Wild</b>:  Whew, I'm done.  Felt good to get that off of my chest!</p>

<P><b>Sigmund, #8</b>:  Okay, great.  So where's our prize??</P>

<P><b>Leo, #6</b>:  Yeah, where is it?!</P>

<P><b>Wild</b>: (puzzled)  That was it.  (Bt)  Don't you feel good, now?</P>

<P><b>Leo & Sigmund</b>:  NO!!!!!!!!!!!</P>


<P> (Cut back to the studio.)  </P>

<P><B>Mike Quinn</B>: Well that went well, didn't it? (Bt) Now for one last
time, back to Daria on the island. (cut to the island) How you holding up
there?   </P>

<P><B>Daria</B>: I'm doing fine, all of the "contestants" went
home and they're starting to tear the set down....   </P>

<P><B>Mike Quinn</B>: (v.o.) Heh, heh, ix-nay on the et-say!  </P>

<P><B>Daria</B>: They wanted to know when they'll get paid.  </P>

<P><B>Mike Quinn</B>: The check is in the mail. (Bt) Anyway, season four
earned a much higher average grade that either season two of season three.
At first, while mulling over that juicy tidbit of data, I really wondered
why that was.  Then it hit me; this season had one thing going for it and
that would be consistency.  While few episodes of season four jumped out as
classics, not many of them belong in the sewer either.  In other words, the
bad episodes weren't really that bad, especially when compared to the worst
of season three.  But what about the specifics?  Daria, the show and the
character, evolved.  Both progressed even further into maturity.  This has
been a common occurrence throughout the series; the main characters grow.
They change, sometimes it's good, sometimes it isn't, but that is part of
the learning process.  Debates have even popped up about how "season
one" Daria would react to "season four" Daria, which, to me,
shows how special this show is.  There feels like there is some larger
plan.  It's probably nothing specific, but there is <I>some</I>
destination, or it least it seems that there is.  While these changes have
caused some long-time fans to abandon the show, I'm sure it has also
attracted a lot of new viewers, too.  Besides, would a show like
<I>Daria</I> have survived for four seasons if every episode was just like
most of the previous episodes, without any feeling of any real progress?  I
think not.  (Bt) Boy, that was a mouthful.  </P>
