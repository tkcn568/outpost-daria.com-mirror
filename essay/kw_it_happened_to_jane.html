<P>Even the staunchest of the canonites and the character development
boosters shifted their eyes away in horror.  What was Jane doing... in a
cheerleading uniform?!</P>

<P>What was she doing??  Oh Lord, what was she <i>doing</i>?!  What sort of
twisted joke was being played on us??  The cries of outrage were so
intense, they were almost palpable.</P>

<P>How could the writers <i>do</i> this to us??  Did they not know that
Jane would <i>never</i> try out for the cheerleading squad, no matter how
pressured, no matter <i>how</i> low her self-esteem, no matter <i>how</i>
much she had "sold out" previously by joining the track team??</P>

<P>Jane is... is... Jane.</P>

<P>Which means she is a rebel.  Which means nonconformity is in her blood,
especially given the fact that her parents are semi-nomadic artists.  This
fact has been established time and time again, in a wide span of episodes
dating back to Season One.</P>

<P>For the writers to suggest she could behave otherwise would mean... they
were writing her out of character.</P>

<P>Such are the strong feelings that foment around the much-maligned Fourth
Season episode, "The 'F' Word."  For those of you who haven't seen it yet
and who <i>like</i> spoilers, what happens is that Jane chooses as her
"failure" assignment to fail at being a conformist.  Unfortunately, she
succeeds too well; the cheerleaders take one look at her scrunchy and teddy
bear backpack and invite her to try out for the squad.  At this point,
given the clues established throughout the series, one might expect Jane to
cold-shoulder them or, better still, to plot a way to humiliate the
cheerleading squad for their acceptance of her at face value.  That is what
we've come to expect from Jane, whose devilish side has shown itself in
episodes like "Esteemers," "The Invitation," "Arts 'N Crass," "The Old and
the Beautiful," "Daria Dance Party," and more.  But instead, Jane is
rattled enough that she gives the squad serious consideration.  She tells
Daria that fitting in was "too easy," and why fight what, perhaps, she was
meant to be all along: a conformist.</P>

<P>So Jane tries out for the squad, only to be saved from utter conformity
by a last-minute dream sequence which suggests she has morphed into
Brittany.  Dilemma resolved.  Except that it wasn't.</P>

<P>Fans flat out would <i>not</i> accept that Jane would let her conformist
tendencies go so far.  As for myself, while I knew that Jane has a
conformist side (as seen by her behavior in "Through a Lens Darkly" and
"See Jane Run"), I severely disliked the rushed and poorly-conceived way in
which her flirtation with this "dark" side was handled.  Had an entire
episode been built around Jane's temptation, it would have been easier.
Instead, it was treated in an off-handed, "Oh well!" manner, given the same
amount of time and importance as Brittany's attempts to fail at being
unpopular.  It seems that the writer of this episode, Rachelle Romberg did
not attach special significance to Jane's deviation from her off-beat norm.
Jane was just "one of the gang" in this episode, which, overall, had a
chipper "Everything's gonna be O.K.!" tone to it.  Except that Jane's
deviation <i>was</i> significant.  For those of us craving a look into her
cloistered psyche, this represented a <i>major</i> opportunity to get to
the heart of Jane Lane.  To see her fears, her vulnerabilities, the
strength and breadth of her values.</P>

<P>What we were left with was something very unsettling.  <i>This</i> was
Jane?  Someone who could discard her cynical values the way she would a
worn-out paintbrush??  Someone whose feelings were treated as casually as
those of any random Lawndale High teen?  It was easier for many fans to
just denounce "The 'F' Word" as an abomination than to accept it as part of
the "Daria" canon.  And that is where those fans and I part ways.</P>

<hr=25%>

<P>To me, "The 'F' Word" is part of the "Daria" canon.  Same as "Through a
Lens Darkly," "Partner's Complaint," "Jane's Addition," and "I Loathe a
Parade."  It is canon because the "Daria" writers wrote it, and because it
was presented to us as an episode devoid of any bizarre fantasy elements
(save Jane's minor dream sequence).</P>

<P>I realize this contradicts the conventions I laid out in "The Off-Canon
Approach."  There, I stated that the "canon" Jane is always sardonic and
the "canon" Daria is always cynical.  But as this essay was written
<i>prior</i> to "Partner's Complaint," the Season Four premiere, and since
it did not make its way to the Outpost Daria Essay section until the
weekend <i>after</i>, several people were quick to point out that my
definition of "canon" was on the restrictive side.  Indeed, it was.</P>

<P>I based my definition on the conventions established in Seasons One and
Two.  Season Three did not really tamper with those conventions, being too
content to produce one episode after another that parodied pop culture.
(Indeed, it could be labeled the "send-up" season, having spoofed MTV,
"Titanic," "Thelma and Louise," "The X-Files," "The Simpsons," and Broadway
musicals.)  Yet during that season, Daria <i>did</i> grow mellower and more
accepting of other people's viewpoints, as shown by her flirtation with
contact lens-wearing and her quiet pleasure when Quinn referred to them as
a "team" in "Speedtrapped."  As for Ms. Jane, she remained ever the
sardonic, unflappable Partner in Crime.  But she <i>did</i>, now and then,
lean toward conformity the way she did in "See Jane Run."  In "Through a
Lens Darkly," Jane not only kept from scorning Daria's decision to wear
contacts, but she even <i>supported</i> it.  Then, in "Jane's Addition,"
Jane gravitated toward a guy who could arguably be called a conformist.
Tom, after all, attends prep school.  He dresses in the same casual manner
as any normal guy.  The advice he gives, such as that Kevin become a safety
lecturer in  "A Tree Grows in Lawndale," is pragmatic, devoid of ideology.
Although Tom is capable of seeing society's absurdities, he still comes
across as someone who could live comfortably amongst the main stream.</P>

<P>Thus, Daria and Jane managed to show subtle changes in Season Three.
But even so, I avoided drawing the conclusion that their values were
shifting, simply because I did not know whether this was temporary.  Then
came Season Four.  Right away, viewers saw that the changes in Season Three
had left their indelible mark on the show.  Tom had not gone away.  In
fact, to point out my big prediction boffo, he has become a semi-regular
cast member, well-positioned to influence Daria and Jane with his pragmatic
outlook.  Daria, as we saw in "Partner's Complaint," has retained her more
flexible-mindedness toward other people's points of view.  Her softer side
would emerge in other episodes as well, such as in "The 'F' Word" and "Of
Human Bonding."</P>

<P>And Jane would reveal that she is someone who can be swayed into trying
out for the cheerleading team.</P>

<hr=25%>

<P>At this point, I still can't tell which offended fans more: that Jane's
cheerleader turn did not receive episode-length treatment, or that she
tried out for cheerleading at all.</P>

<P>With regard to the former, I can understand the frustration.  Romberg
just sort of tossed out a half-dozen plotlines that, except for the school
assignment, had little connection to one another.  She gave a hefty role to
the grating and already overexposed Kevin and Brittany.  (Even worse: their
plotline was just a reprise of the events that had taken place in "A Tree
Grows in Lawndale.")  Jane's popularity dilemma did not receive as much
time and attention as it deserved.</P>

<P>And yet somehow I sense that all this just sharpened the sting of the
<i>true</i> offense, which was that Jane tried out for cheerleading.  Her
behavior forced us to ask tough questions.  Should we just see it as out of
character andleave it at that?  A rush job on the writer's part?  Or worse:
an example that Glenn Eichler and his fellow writers have sold their souls
to MTV and are trying to appeal to a more mainstream crowd in exchange for
ratings???</P>

<P><i>Or</i> is this just a taste of what might be fleshed out in a future
episode?  Why be so quick to condemn Rachelle Romberg who, after all, wrote
the definitive Jane episode, "See Jane Run"?  An episode which wryly poked
fun at high school's indulgence of its athletes, as well as provided a
little insight into Jane and some tension within Daria and Jane's
friendship.  Should we assume that the values which compelled Romberg to
pen that episode have undergone a major overhaul since?</P>

<P>Before I go into that any further, I suggest we take a closer look at
Jane's plotline in "The 'F' Word."  For one thing, notice the reason Jane
gives for trying out for cheerleading: "fitting in was too easy."  She does
<i>not</i> say, "Wow, the cheerleaders are, like, <i>really</i> cool and I
never noticed it before, but now I DO!"  Or, "Gee, Daria, I don't
understand why you don't like popular people; they're not so bad."</P>

<P>Perhaps it would have been better, more Jane-like, if she had just
smirked at the cheerleaders' invitation and waved them off.  But instead,
she finds herself plagued with seemingly uncharacteristic uncertainty.  For
once she has been hit in the face with an opportunity to conform, one for
which she has expressed vague longing in the past.  Yet just as quickly as
Jane gets this uncertainty, her nonconformist values re-establish
themselves.  She picks up a pom-pom and, with a wry expression, murmurs,
"Cheer, cheer, cheer.  Yell, yell, yell.  Who cares who wins?  We're all
going to hell."</P>

<P>So in the end, Jane condemns popularity.  And "The 'F' Word," itself,
hardly does any less.  In fact, this episode may cast the most critical eye
on the "p" word since "The Invitation."  As it unfolds, we see that the
cheerleaders are cliquish, snotty, and absorbed in their own narrow-minded
view of the world.  They turn on Brittany, forcing her off the squad, when
she tries to express an interest in world events.  In some ways, "The 'F'
Word even surpasses "The Invitation" in its harsh treatment of popularity.
Where <i>else</i> have we seen such back-biting, other than in the Fashion
Club power struggles?  And because those struggles are often promoted as an
amusing side show to the main event, they get dismissed as lacking genuine
substance.  Yet in "The 'F' Word," we could see that the F.C. problems are
but part of a more widespread cruelty in the name of being popular.</P>

<P>When all is said and done, Jane is <i>Jane</i> again by the end of the
episode -- cracking jokes about alien probes, acting weirded out by Mr.
O'Neill's New Age décor.  So the only damage, perhaps, could be that Jane's
uncertainty did not receive an episode unto itself.  Or rather, that Jane
expressed uncertainty at all.</P>

<hr=25%>

<P>Why did her supposedly rock-solid values fluctuate now, during
<i>this</i> season, as opposed to during Season One, when "The Invitation"
aired?  One thing is for certain: Jane's <i>uncertainty</i> in "The 'F'
Word" seems to mirror our own about Season Four.  In fact, Season Four's
very <i>theme</i> could be uncertainty.</P>

<P>Since Season Two, we have seen that "Daria" is a show in which the
characters change.  Many and most of us have welcomed that change, to the
point where we have become impatient to see [more] changes, ones that we
think ought to occur.  As I mentioned earlier, most changes were
extraordinarily subtle and difficult to read.  Daria considers Helen's
advice on wearing contact lenses in "Through a Lens Darkly"; does that mean
she's starting to appreciate her mother more?  Quinn sighs cryptically when
Sandi criticizes her for looking "sick" in "Daria!"; does that mean she's
really more sensitive and aware than people give her credit for??  Were the
characters really changing on a linear course, or were the writers
haphazardly bestowing them with growth without bothering to guide it
along?</P>

<P>Now the changes are <i>not</i> so subtle.  Perhaps we should consider it
to be the legacy of three years of more subtle change, and yes,
<i>growth</i>.  Things have built up to the point where they can't help but
be more noticeable, such as Daria's softening relationship with her family
and a few cracks in Jane's unflappable façade.  Things build up, add up,
until the viewer can no longer dismiss them the way he or she used to.  So
if Jane's uncertainty shows up now, we might view it as a fuller
manifestation of the vulnerability first shown in Season Two.</P>

<P>Ironically, the changes in Daria and Jane seem to have been accelerated,
or at least made clearer, by the fact that the writers are paying more
attention to what they did in the past.  We can see this especially in
gratuitous flashbacks to previous episodes ("Antisocial Climbers") and
references to or appearances by characters from past seasons. It follows,
therefore, that the writers would try to determine how Daria, Jane, and co.
have been altered by their past experiences. Through the <b>story arc</b>,
a device which did not exist on "Daria" until this season, we can now watch
our favorite characters go through a whole sequence of changes, from start
to finish, with a clear purpose in mind.  It's what many of us fans have
clamored, and now we're getting it.</P>

<P>Yet now that the once-subtle changes on "Daria" are starting to mount,
fans watch and worry with anxiety.  What's going to happen?!  Will Daria
and Jane's screen time continue to be sacrificed to more grating characters
like Kevin and Brittany?  Will they change beyond all recognition?  Will
the writers, who seemed so certain of their path in Season Two when they
first began these changes, lose their way?</P>

<P>Everyone seems to have found an episode that has made him/her all but
swear off "Daria."  For some, it was "Partner's Complaint."  For others, it
was "I Loathe a Parade."  For many, many people, it was "The 'F' Word."
For me, it was "Of Human Bonding" -- which, ironically, I disliked because
it did not present <i>enough</i> change, at least not the positive change I
had hoped for.  Change that would push along some very stagnant plotlines.
You know to which I'm referring.</P>

<P>I, too, watch "Daria" with some anxiety.  It's the fourth season; by
now, certain patterns ought to become more fixed.  Season Three threw us
all off a little in terms of linear progression from Seasons One and Two,
thanks to the smattering of fantasy and parody episodes.  Shouldn't Season
Four now restore our faith?  I, who cherish character development and who
had Jane flirt with conformity in "Outvoted," watched her cheerleader turn
in "The 'F' Word" with a queesy stomach.  How could I interpret it??  Were
the "Daria" writers failing to deliver the character development that they
had seemed to promise us?  Or was I simply unhappy that they weren't
developing Jane in a way I <i>thought</i> she should be developed?</P>

<hr=25%>

<P>After several hours of stewing, I reached this bottom line: the
characters are changing on "Daria."  But we don't know how much, and we
don't know whether it will be in a way that will satisfy each of us, with
our <i>very</i> specialized expectations.  Will Daria stay cynical?  Will
Quinn <i>ever</i> challenge Sandi?  Will Trent leave Mystik Spiral?  Will
Jane become a complete conformist?  That is for the writers on "Daria" to
decide.  Everything the writers write is canon, which means that "The 'F'
Word" is now a part of the canon, which means that Change itself is woven
into the very fabric of "Daria."</P>

<P>Will Glenn Eichler and co. send "Daria" spinning downhill?  We don't
know.  We <i>won't</i> know until the rest of the season unfolds.  Or until
we see what happens next season.  Or see if there are seasons after that.
Nor will we know if Glenn sold out to MTV.  So why worry about it?</P>

<P>One thing I do know, is that it's ridiculous for us to be in denial at
this point.  To treat episodes like "The 'F' Word" or "Partner's Complaint"
as abominations that don't exist.  Well they <i>do</i> exist.  I mean hey,
if we go with that attitude, we might as well just erase from our minds
<i>any</i> episode of "Daria" we didn't like.  "The New Kid"?  Never aired.
Same with "Malled," "This Year's Model," "Just Add Water," or "Jane's
Addition."  Why not just pretend that there <i>have</i> been no seasons
beyond Season Two??  Beyond Season <i>One</i>??  Swear ignorance at the
very suggestion that Daria might have gone out with someone who wasn't
Trent, or that she ever had a lapse in judgment, or that she ever went soft
on a member of her family.  Let's pretend that Daria and Jane are perfect
beings who are always right and are impervious to the weaknesses of
society.</P>

<P>We can pretend all we want.  But it won't change the fact that these
episodes exist.  And yes, that includes "Depth Takes a Holiday."</P>

<P>These sentiments extend to fan fiction.  Fan fiction has been used since
Season One to fulfill our desires, always with the expectations that while
the show would continue to be of high quality, there was no way it could
realistically cover as much ground as we wanted it to.  It has <i>not</i>,
however, been used as a <i>substitute</i> for the show.  Nor should it
ever.  If fanfic authors feel that the quality of the show has lapsed, that
it has reached a point where they can no longer watch without disgust, then
they should stop writing.  It is absolutely counter-productive to use one's
writing talent to "save" the show or "change" the show.  "Daria" is not a
rain forest.</P>

<P>It is also not a country, in which its citizens, the fans, can protest
and expect to see the leaders, Glenn Eichler and the rest of the "Daria"
writers, fold to our desires.  As we fret, they are already deep into
production for Season Five; our protests will fall on deaf ears.</P>

<P>The fact is that in spite of all of our conjectures, we have no idea
what Glenn Eichler has in mind for "Daria."  We never have.  So why
complain that he who was once the Holder of All That is Good has betrayed
us??  Eichler has not betrayed us.  We were never, ever on intimate terms
with the preparation and the planning and the ideology that went into the
creation of this show.</P>

<P>Those who call themselves "Daria" fans: I suggest that if you intend to
remain fans, you'd best let go of the over-inflated hopes, expectations,
and hysteria.  They won't get you anywhere.  Just accept the fact that "The
'F' Word" happened, and it happened to Jane.</P>

and her world:</P>

<P><b>Where Have All the Bullies Gone?</b>: A look at the seeming absence
of dark forces at Lawndale High, and how that might affect Daria's
cynicism, or lack thereof.</P>

<P><b>Everyone But Daria?</b>: An examination/defense of my continuum, and
how it might relate to the ensemble episodes of Season Four.</P>
