"Daria" is owned and copyrighted by MTV. All rights reserved.  This
is *not* an episode, but the best imitation of an episode that I 
could write.  Thanks to the creators of "Daria" for providing so much 
rich material for fanfics....

This is the ninth fic in my chronology.  It follows 1) "Rose-Colored 
Lenses," 2) "The Tie That Chokes," 3) "That Thing You Say," 4) 
"'Shipped Out," 5) "Andrea Speaks!", 6) "Cheered Down," 7) "None in 
the Family, Part One," and 8) "None in the Family, Part Two."

**Now brace yourselves: I've given my continuum a NAME.  But I'm 
going to force you to read through this fanfic before learning what 
it is. :-)**

Consider this the third of my three "competitive chick" fics.  The 
first two, of course, were "Andrea Speaks!" and "Cheered Down."

I'd give it a 2S... not as long as "None in the Family, Part Two"! 
And although it's sort of dark, it's not as heavy, either...

*And* last but not least, I must apologize: I'd drafted this fic 
prior to the airing of "Jane's Addition," and couldn't figure out how 
to work in a reference to her new beau, Tom.  But I *will* in future 
fanfics.  Just assume that for now, he's hovering in the background
somewhere.  Tom *Griffin* appears briefly, though.

Oh, and if I didn't say so before... enjoy!!


Ten Spot Promo:  The one where the woman's running in the woods.  She 
falls, turns on the tape recorder thingy, then gets up and runs off. 
Yeah, I know I've used this before, but MTV reuses its Ten Spot 
promos, so what the hay...

ACT ONE

SCENE 1 (Lawndale High)

(Shot of the outside.  Cut to shot of Jane and Daria standing in the 
hallway by their lockers.  It's after third period, and students are 
milling about everywhere.  Suddenly, from offscreen overhead: )

MS. LI:  Attention all students --

JANE: (to Daria)  Eureka!  She found the P.A.

DARIA: (deadpan)  So those drug-sniffing dogs *are* good for something.

MS. LI:  I would like to make a brief little announcement.

(Daria and Jane roll their eyes, knowing the announcement will be 
anything *but* brief.)

MS. LI:  First, I would like to say once again how deeeeply *upset* I 
am about Dean McBale's little grade-changing enterprise.  I was never 
so *shocked* in my life --

JANE:  "Shocked"?

DARIA:  Then she was the only one.

MS. LI:  -- when I found out.  But let's hope the student body 
president that *succeeds* him will do a better job upholding the 
honor of Laaaaaaaawndale High.  And with *that* said, let me read out 
the names of the nominees...

(Beat.  Daria and Jane exchange wary glances.)

JANE:  Not *another* election.
[*] see "Andrea Speaks!"

DARIA:  Weren't you awake when we picked the nominees second period?

JANE:  When have I ever been awake before third period?

DARIA:  Point taken.

MS. LI:  These students represent the *top* two vote-grabbers of the 
student body, the ones --

(Jodie walks up to Daria and Jane.)

JODIE:  Hey, you guys.

DARIA & JANE:  Hey.

JANE: (to Jodie)  This election thing must have you pretty excited.

JODIE:  Why?

MS. LI:  -- for the good of democracy and -- oh blah, blah, blah. 
Anyhow, the *first* of our top nominees is (Pause) Sandra Griffin...

(Daria and Jane look at each other and cringe.)

MS. LI:  And our *second* nominee is (long Pause) er... um... 
(disbelief)  Jane... Lane??

(Daria and Jodie get expressions of shock.)

JANE: (calm)  Whoa, Jodie, *you* weren't nominated??

MS. LI: (muttering)  *Dammit*, they must have put *her* name instead 
of Jodie Landon's by *mistake*...

DARIA:  (to Jane.  deadpan)  Perhaps it's escaped your attention that 
*you* were.

JANE:  Hmm, yeah, so I was.  (Pause.  it sinks in.)  *Whoa*!  How the 
hell did *that* happen??!

(Just then, Brittany and Kevin walk onscreen, Brittany wearing her 
cheerleader's uniform once again.)

KEVIN: (goofy cheerful)  Brit and I nominated you.

BRITTANY: (spacy cheerful)  An' I got all the *cheerleaders* to vote for you!

DARIA:  Somehow I knew there was a mental error behind this.

JANE: (to Brittany and Kevin.  dry)  And why *me* of all people?

KEVIN:  Well *duh*!  Our teacher said to nominate someone good at the 
*art* of governing.

BRITTANY:  And no one's better at art than *you* are, Jane!

JANE:  I had to ask.

BRITTANY:  Ooh, I could make up a cheer for you!  (Bt)  Give me a 
*J*, give me an *A*, give me an --

JANE: (trying to get rid of them)  Oh *look* -- talent scouts for 
football and supermodeling *way* over there.  (points into the
distance.)

BRITTANY & KEVIN:  Ooh!  (they run off.)

(Jane exhales with relief.  She then sees Daria smirking.)

JANE:  I hate you.

(Jodie chuckles, obviously finding humor in the situation as well. 
Jane turns to her.)

JANE:  So, Jodie, you still haven't answered my question: why aren't 
*you* running??

DARIA:  And if you say you weren't nominated, just remember: in some 
states it's a felony for your nose to be more than twelve inches long.

JODIE: (rolling her eyes amusedly)  I *was* nominated.  But I turned it down.

DARIA & JANE:  Why??

(Beat)

JODIE:  Look you guys, I've got a lot to handle already, what with my 
other activities and being *vice*-president...

DARIA: (sardonic)  Oh yeah.  Vice-president's an important office.

JANE:  The highest office one can occupy without doing any real work.

(Jodie rolls her eyes again, this time looking sort of annoyed.)

JODIE:  For your information, the vice-president has *loads* of 
responsibilities -- and my most important one's to keep the 
*president* in line.

(Jane and Daria glance at each other.  Neither is completely 
satisfied with Jodie's response, but they know better than to press.)

(cut to: )

SCENE 2 (Pizza King, that afternoon)

(Shot of the outside.  Cut to shot of Daria and Jane sitting in a 
booth, eating.  Offscreen, we hear the sounds of Brittany practicing 
a cheer.)

BRITTANY:  Give me a *J*!  Give me an *A*!  Give me an... um, an *I*...!

(Jane tosses her hands in the air with exasperation.)

JANE:  Would she just *stop* already?!  When I'm president, the first 
thing to go will be cheerleaders and their incessant feel-good 
prattle.

DARIA:  Not even president yet, and already you're planning your 
first genocide.

JANE: (smirking)  I like to think big.  (Pause.  sighs, comes back to 
reality.)  So, um, when *Sandi's* president, you think there'll be 
many changes in the way the school's run?

DARIA: (sardonic)  Uh-huh.  And all for the better.  (Bt)  I know 
*I'm* looking forward to "A Century of 'Waif'" becoming course in our 
curriculum.

JANE:  And to moving down to the basement, where *all* the unpopular 
and unattractive people will be separated from their social superiors.

DARIA: (smirking)  That's nothing compared to what she'll do to the 
Fashion Club.

JANE: (wicked)  Ah yes, I can see it now.  Quinn and them will be 
made into Sandi's personal *slaves*, forced to kneel on the ground 
and kiss her Gucci sandals whenever she passes by -- in the process, 
messing up their hair, make-up, and cute little bondage gowns.

(As Daria smirks and readies a reply, we see Jodie walking over to them.)

JODIE:  Hi guys.  Talking about Jane's campaign?

DARIA:  Wow.  Two Jodie encounters in a single day.

JANE:  What's the occasion?

JODIE: (good-naturedly)  Knock it off.

(Beat)

JANE:  We're just envisioning life under the Griffin administration.

JODIE: (surprised)  You don't think *you* could be president, Jane?

(Beat)

JANE: (rolling her eyes)  Aw c' mon, Jodie, *look* at me.  These 
designer threads and holes in my ears scream "weirdo."

DARIA: (to Jodie)  You've now entered Outcast Central.  Population: 
no one who'd be here if they had a choice.

JANE:  And no one's gonna elect an outcast president.

DARIA:  Not that we'd want to be president in the first place.

JODIE:  What do you mean?

JANE: (puzzled)  Yeah, what *do* you mean?

(Beat)

DARIA: (to Jodie)  I mean we outcasts have a hard and fast rule 
against joining mainstream student activities.  No sports.  No clubs. 
No corruption, no incrimination.   We may be pathetic, but at least 
we have our integrity.

JODIE: (cocking a brow)  Is that what you think, *Jane*?

(Jane shrugs.)

JANE: (sheepish)  Well... I *did* get burned when I was on the track 
team last year.  Better if I just let my candidacy fade into the 
sunset.

(Beat)

JODIE:  I'm sorry you feel that way -- 'cause I was gonna offer you 
some campaign strategies.

JANE: (pleasant)  Thanks but no thanks.  Why don't you take your 
can-do attitude to another poor sap who needs it?

(Jodie shrugs, looking vaguely disappointed.)

JODIE:  If that's how you feel.  (Bt)  See you guys later.  (she leaves.)

DARIA & JANE:  Bye.

(Beat)

DARIA:  So with that, we allow Sandi Griffin, Ms. Popularity, her 
easy ascension to the throne.

JANE:  Now even if I *were* going to run, would that outcome have 
changed?  (Bt.  sort of bitter)  Boy, I can just see Sandi's *smug* 
little face as she plots her first official abuses of power...

(cut to: )

SCENE 3 (Griffin residence, evening)

(Shot of the outside.  Cut to close-up shot of Sandi.)

SANDI:  There's no *way* I'm running for president!

(Cut to wider shot of the Griffins doing fondue in the dining room. 
Sandi's sitting across from Linda at one end of the table, while Tom, 
Sam, and Chris sit at the other end.  Tom's struggling to prevent Sam 
and Chris from gouging each other's eyes out with their fondue 
sticks.  Meanwhile, Sandi and Linda talk as though they're the only 
ones in the room.)

LINDA: (cocking a brow)  Now Sandi, that's *loser*-talk.  I didn't 
raise you to be a *loser*, did I?

(Sandi slumps forward and swirls her stick in the fondue, a sulky 
expression on her face.)
 
SANDI:  No.  (Bt)  But if I run for *president*, everyone'll, like, 
think I'm some kind of *student*.  Like I care about the school, or 
*something*.

LINDA:  *Sandi*, must I remind you to keep your focus on the *big* picture?

SANDI:  *What* big picture??

(Linda sighs sharply, as if the answer is obvious.)

LINDA:  That you could gain a lot of *influence* at your school.  And 
make *contacts* that could jump-start your future career.

(Beat)

SANDI: (rolling her eyes.  haughty)  Contacts?  In *high* school??

(Beat)

LINDA: (annoyed -- Sandi has a point)  *Or* being president would 
*light* up your college resume.  And let's face it: it could *use* 
help.  A lot of it.

(Sandi absorbs this comment with a resentful sneer.)

LINDA:  Do you think *I* got where I am today by *shirking* 
opportunities like this?

SANDI:  You mean from news anchor to marketing V.P.?

(Pause.  Linda's eyes narrow slightly.  Sandi knows she's hit a sore 
spot, but she's too irritated to enjoy her brief advantage. 
Continues to sit there with a sulky expression.  Meanwhile Tom's 
extracted himself long enough from Sam and Chris's feud to catch part 
of the dialogue.  He tries to be of some help.)

TOM:  You know, when I was in high school --

LINDA:  *Tom*?  Did I *say* you could be a part of this conversation?

TOM: (chuckling uneasily)  Well no, but I just assumed --

LINDA:  *Don't* bother to assume, because when you do, you're wrong. 
Better to just let *me* do the assuming for the *both* of us, hmm' 
kay?

(Beat.  Tom wilts.)

TOM:  Fine.

LINDA:  Good.  (turns back to Sandi, cool and triumphant once again 
after the reprimand.)  And as for *you*, Sandi --

SANDI: (in no mood for a lecture)  Look, Mother, even if I do 
*nothing* for this stupid election, I'll probably win by a 
*landslide*.  I'm up against some loser-freak *nobody*.

LINDA:  Sandi, *what* did I just say about assuming?  Complacency can 
lead to ruin.  (Bt)  If you hadn't been so *complacent* about being 
president of the *Fashion* Club, you wouldn't've  --

SANDI: (looking slightly wounded)  But I *wasn't*!  I was just being
nice to that *stupid* Quinn Morgendorffer because she fell off the
*stupid* pyramid.  How was *I* s'posed to know they'd make her
president after I let her back in??
[*] see "Cheered Down"

LINDA:  That's *exactly* my point.  You weren't ready for her, and
she *got* you.  And you still haven't recovered from *your* fall,
have you?

SANDI: (glaring)  I would have if they'd've let me form *another*
fashion club...

LINDA:  There's no point in dreaming about the past.  If you want to avoid
that kind of *humiliation* a second time, you'd better *get* on
the ball and *work* to secure your victory.  Otherwise, who can 
predict the *self-esteem* spiral you could g--

SANDI:  All *right*, Mom.

LINDA:  And let me remind you *again* that I didn't raise you to be a 
*quitter* --

SANDI:  I *know*.  (Bt)  God, you give me, like, this same speech 
every freaking *week*.

(Beat.  Linda cocks a warning eyebrow -- "Strike two."  Sam and Chris 
stop what they're doing, recognizing these warning signs, and start 
pointing and laughing at Sandi.  Sandi rolls her eyes.)

SANDI: (coolly)  You know what??  I think I'll go upstairs an' make 
some *phone* calls now.  To help *jump* start my campaign.

(As she stands up, she sees Linda nod with approval.)

SANDI:  It's been real.  (she leaves.)

(Pause.  Linda watches her go, then gets a calculating look on her face.)

LINDA:  Hmmm...

(cut to: )

SCENE 4 (Lawndale High, a couple of days later)

(Shot of the outside.  Cut to close-up shot of a poster of Sandi. 
She's posed in a way that one can't help but call "seductive," above 
a caption that  reads: "How Can You Resist?  Vote Sandi Griffin for 
president."  Cut to a wider shot -- we see that the poster is one of 
many to line the walls of the hallway.  Several people are staring at 
them, including Daria and Jane.)

JANE: (shaking her head.  hushed)  The girl works fast, I'll give her that.

DARIA: (deadpan)  And if she puts as much effort into governing as 
she did into choosing a photogenic eyeliner, she'll be the best 
president this school's ever known.

JANE:  Or ever *will* know.

(We then hear Sandi's voice from offscreen, and see her stride past
Daria and Jane without so much as acknowledging them.  She's too busy 
being admired by an entourage of students.  Pan shot to follow her.)

SANDI: (in the midst of answering someone's question)  ... Of 
*course* there'll be parties every Friday.  There has to be 
*something* worthwhile at this school.

MALE STUDENT:  Will there be swimsuit models at these parties?

(Beat)

SANDI:  I'll see what I can do.

(Sandi stops at her locker, and the group forms a circle around her. 
As she continues to talk, we see Quinn, Tiffany, and Stacy creep up 
and stand on the sidelines.  Tiffany and Stacy look awed, Quinn 
steamed.)

TIFFANY: (hushed)  Wow...

STACY:  Real-live swimsuit models...

(Beat)

QUINN: (irritated)  Oh come *on*, you don't honestly believe she can 
*do* that, do you??

(Pause)

STACY: (shrugs her shoulders.  admitting)  I guess not.

(Beat)

TIFFANY:  But it'll still be really *cool* if Sandi becomes president.

QUINN:  *Why*, Tiffany??

TIFFANY: (vague surprise)  'Cause she could do a lot of big *favors* for us.

(Beat)

QUINN: (trying to be patient, but there's an edge in her voice)  Why 
would she *want* to do us any favors??  Sandi *hates* us, remember??

(Tiffany and Stacy both exchange doubtful looks.)

STACY:  Oh... I don't think she *hates* us.  I mean, just because she 
hasn't talked to us in a month --

SANDI: (snotty tone)  Um, *excuse* me: you three in the back --

(Quinn, Tiffany, and Stacy turn to see Sandi giving them a freezing look.)

SANDI: -- could you, like, kindly *shut* your little traps while I'm 
talking??  This isn't, like, *preschool*.

(The comment is met with mild laughter from the crowd.  Quinn's eyes 
narrow, while Tiffany and Stacy look surprised.)

QUINN: (dripping with faux graciousness)  Oh, of *course* we will, Sandi.

STACY & TIFFANY: Yeah.  We're sorry.

SANDI:  Hmph, *thank* you.  (tosses her hair.  to the crowd.)  Now as 
I was *saying*: another thing I'll try to do when I'm president is 
crack down on fashion *phonies*.  (pointed glance at Quinn and the 
other F.C.'s.)  You know -- people who tell you what you should wear 
when it, like, turns out to be totally *wrong* an' you end up looking 
like a *freak*...

(Other students glance at Quinn, who responds by gritting her teeth 
and walking away.  Several of the male students watch her go with 
longing, and look as though they want to pursue, but Sandi's 
throat-clearing recaptures their attention.  After a few seconds, 
Tiffany and Stacy follow Quinn.  Pause.)

STACY:  Hmm, I guess she *does* hate us.

TIFFANY:  Yeah.

(Beat)

QUINN:  She's just being a *baby*.  Ever since she *dropped* out 
'cause she could no longer be *our* president...

STACY: (wilted)  Yeah.

(Beat.  Quinn puts a hand to her forehead.)

QUINN: (semi-melodramatic)  Oh *God*, she's probably already cooked 
up a scheme to get *rid* of us!

TIFFANY:  Really?

STACY: (sounding worried)  How?

QUINN:  Who *knows* how??  Maybe by cutting our funding 'til the only 
place left we can afford to shop is (shudders)  *J.J. Jeeters*.

TIFFANY: (horrified)  *Ugh*!

STACY: (putting her face in her hands)  Oh no, *no*!

TIFFANY:  But if that's true, shouldn't we be trying to stay on 
Sandi's *good* side?

(Beat.  Quinn stops in her tracks and spins around to face Tiffany.)

QUINN: (irritated)  If *you* wanna suck up to Sandi, go right ahead. 
*I've* got other plans.

(She stalks off, leaving Tiffany and Stacy behind.  Cut to shot of 
Daria and Jane, still looking at Sandi's poster.  Quinn comes over to 
them, stomps on the floor.)

QUINN:  *Dammit*, Lane, you'd better win this election!

JANE: (sardonic)  Whoa.  We're on a *last* name basis, now, are we? 
To what do I owe --

QUINN:  Don't make jokes -- this *isn't* funny!  My whole *future* 
depends on whether you or *Sandi* gets elected.

DARIA: (deadpan)  Hoping to ride the wave of nepotism to a cushy 
high-level position?

QUINN: (ignoring her.  to Jane)  You *do* realize that one word from 
"President Sandi" and the Fashion Club could be *history*, don't you??

JANE: (wicked delight)  Yes, the thought *had* crossed my mind.

(Quinn glares at her.)

JANE:  And sometimes, when life tosses you these kinds of lemons --

DARIA: (smirking)  You just gotta suck them dry.

(Beat)

QUINN: (sarcastic)  Gee, I'm glad you guys're so understanding. 
'Cause if the Fashion Club splits up, I'm gonna have a lot of free 
time on my hands.

DARIA:  Which you could use constructively.

JANE:  Yeah -- like form a new club: "Fashion Club *Anonymous*." 
Where people learn to put aside their petty obsession with exterior 
qualities in order to focus on (dramatic pause) the beauty *within*.

DARIA: (deadpan)  F.C.A.: helping fashion victims regain their sanity 
one day at a time.

(Quinn rolls her eyes.)

QUINN:  Actually, I was thinking I could spend my free time giving 
makeovers to all the *losers* around me.  (looks pointedly at Jane 
and Daria, who go pale.)

DARIA:  You wouldn't.

QUINN: (smirking) Watch me.

(Beat)

JANE: (to Quinn)  Okay, crazy thought: if you're so worried, why 
don't *you* run for president?  You'd probably have a better shot 
than I would.

QUINN: (tossing her hands in the air)  Are you *kidding*??  I turned 
it down.  I have better things to do.

(Daria and Jane rolls their eyes at her illogic.  Quinn gives up 
trying to appeal to them and walks away.  Pause)

JANE: (peevish)  That girl just drained all the fun out of my non-candidacy.

DARIA:  Don't let her get to you.  (Bt)  Just imagine the hell we'll 
put her through when she tries to make us over.

JANE: (wicked)  When she starts to do our hair -- diabetic seizure 
right on the ground.

DARIA: (smirking)  That's the spirit.  (Pause.  sees that Jane has 
suddenly gone reflective.)  Jane?

JANE:  Yo.

DARIA:  What're you doing?

(Beat)

JANE:  I'm wondering how well people could "resist" Sandi if her 
posters got some facial hair and a few well-placed warts.  *And* I'm 
imagining a bunch of my really cool art designs next to them.

DARIA:  Art designs?  (Bt.  frowns)  Wait, you're not thinking of 
running, are you?

(Jane shrugs.)

JANE:  I dunno.  (Bt)  I mean, what would be so bad about it?

DARIA:  For starters: the fact that no office is worth what you have 
to go through to get it.  Sandi Griffin would eat you alive.

JANE:  Nah she wouldn't -- too afraid of weight gain.

(Beat.  Daria rolls her eyes, realizing it will be difficult to get 
through to Jane.)

DARIA:  And as much as we joke about the president having so much 
power, when all's said and done, he'sjust an empty suit.  Ms. *Li* 
runs the show at this school.

(Jane frowns and nods in agreement.)

DARIA: (continuing)  *Everyone* knows that.  About all the president 
can do is give perks to the cronies who elected him.  (Bt)  Sure, I'd 
like my own walk-in locker, but not if it means watching you get 
manipulated by the powers above.

(Pause)

JANE: (reflective)  Yeah, I understand.  (Bt)  But maybe it doesn't 
have to be that way.  Maybe I could change things...

DARIA: (skeptical)  Like how?

(Beat.  Jane shrugs.)

JANE:  I don't know.  It was just a thought.

DARIA:  Well if I were you, I'd think about something more plausible. 
Like manning the first space mission to Pluto.

(Pause.  Jane heaves a sigh.)

JANE: (slightly peevish)  You always know how to deliver that ray of 
sunshine *just* when I need it, don't you?

(fade-out.  fade-in to: )

SCENE 5 (Lane house, that evening)

(Shot of the outside.  Cut to shot of Jane sitting at the kitchen 
table, sipping herbal tea.  Offscreen, we hear a loud, badly-played 
chord.  Jane doesn't even flinch.  We then see Trent waltz into the 
kitchen, guitar in hand, to make coffee.)

TRENT:  Hey, Janey.

JANE:  Hey.  (Bt)  Yo, Trent, could I have some advice?

TRENT:  Advice?  (Bt)  I dunno.  Advice sounds kind of... *authoritarian*.

(Jane rolls her eyes with amused exasperation.)

JANE:  Not if you don't hold a *gun* to the person's head and force 
them to follow through.

(Beat)

TRENT:  Hmm... good point.  (Bt)  Okay, what's up?

(Beat)

JANE:  Well... some idiots put me in sort of a bind by nominating me 
for student body president.

(Trent cocks a coolly-impressed eyebrow.)

TRENT:  Whoa, really?

JANE: (hushed, with disbelief)  Yeah... really.  (Bt)  Who'd've thought, huh?

TRENT:  President.  Now that's *real* authority.

JANE:  I'll say.  (Bt)  I mean, it's something I'd've never gone for 
on my own, but now that the opportunity's fallen into my lap...

(Beat)

TRENT:  You're thinking you wanna go for it?

JANE:  Um, yeah.  (Bt)  What d' you think?

TRENT:  Hmmmmm....

(long Pause.  Jane gets impatient waiting for him to respond.)

JANE:  *Daria* doesn't think I should.  She's given me a lot of good 
reasons not to run, but... I'm not so sure I want to consider them.

TRENT:  Why not?

(Beat.  Jane flushes a little with uncharacteristic embarrassment.)

JANE: (awkward)  'Cause I mean... why shouldn't I run?  Isn't the 
student body president supposed to represent *everybody*?   (Bt)  I
may not be as popular as the other girl who's running, but I *did* 
get nominated fair and square.

TRENT:  Hmmm... good point.
 
JANE:  And Daria's a really great friend, but sometimes I think she 
takes her glass-half-empty philosophy *too* far.

TRENT: (looking reflective)  Hmmm...

(Jane's so absorbed in her problem, she doesn't even realize she 
could've messed up the chance to pair Trent with Daria.)

JANE: (frustrated)  Or maybe I'm just being stupid.  (slight chuckle) 
Like *I* could put together a campaign that would actually *beat* 
Sandi Griffin.  I'm not even the competitive type.

TRENT:  True.

JANE:  So... forget I said anything.  (shakes her head.)  Bad idea, Jane.

(Pause)

TRENT:  Dunno.  Maybe not so bad.

JANE:  Really?

TRENT:  Yeah.  Why should you have to give up on a dream just 'cause 
some people say it's not meant to be?  Man, if *I'd* listened to all 
the naysayers out there, I'd've never joined Mystik Spiral.

JANE:  So --

TRENT: (going of on a self-indulgent rant)  Instead I'd be wasting my 
life, wearing a *straightjacket* they call a "suit and tie," forced 
to listen to crappy *elevator* music every morning on the way up to 
my *big* office.  Bitter.  Angry.  Ready to kill, ready t --

JANE:  *Trent*.

(Beat)

TRENT:  Sorry.  (Bt)  What I mean to say is if you wanna go for 
president, Janey, go for president.  (Bt)  Even if you're not as 
popular as the other girl, I'll bet you're just as smart.  You've got 
as much to offer that school as anyone else.

(Jane smirks with gratitude.)

JANE:  Thanks, Trent.  It means a lot to hear you say that.

TRENT:  Any time, Janey.  (Pause.  looks at the coffee label.) 
Dammit -- decaf.  Who bought that?  (Bt)  Oh yeah, guess it was me. 
I'd better go buy some real stuff -- gonna pull an all-nighter.  (Bt) 
See ya.  (walks out of the kitchen.)

JANE:  Later, Trent.

(Pause.  Then Jane stands up and walks over to the phone.  Hesitates 
before dialing, then lays it against her ear.  Pause.)

JANE:  Hi, Jodie?  It's me, Jane.  How'd you like to talk campaign strategy?

ACT TWO

SCENE 1 (Lawndale High, a couple of days later)

(Shot of the outside.  Cut to close-up shot of a poster containing 
swirly colors and abstract shapes.  Cut to wider shot -- that poster, 
and many more like them, are spread across the hallway, alongside the 
Sandi posters.  We see Jane, Daria, and Jodie gazing at them.  Jane 
is smirking triumphantly, Daria's deadpan, Jodie neutral.  It's in 
between classes, and we see several people walking to and fro.)

JANE: (gesturing at one poster)  Well *voila*!  That's the last of 'em.

(Beat)

DARIA:  Very colorful.

JODIE:  Um, yeah.

JANE:  So do they say Jane Lane or *what*??

(Beat)

DARIA:  Actually, "what" was the word I was grasping for.  As in what *is* it?

JANE: (waving her arms energetically)  It's unconventionality!  It's 
freedom of expression!  It says "Jane Lane is an original"!

DARIA:  An original nutcase?

(Beat.  Jane frowns mildly at her.  Before she can respond: )

MS. LI: (over the P.A.)  Attention students: in a moment, I will be 
playing a campaign song for Ms. Jane Lane.  And let's remember to 
*rock* the vote in three weeks!

(Pause.  Daria and Jodie look at Jane questioningly.)

JANE:  Oh yeah -- did I mention Trent wrote and recorded a campaign 
song for me?

DARIA:  *Trent*??

JANE:  Yeah -- he really got inspired.  (Bt)  But what's even weirder 
is that Ms. Li seemed completely okay with me playing it.  I thought 
she'd just blow me off, but she actually seemed (cringes a little) 
*happy*.

JODIE:  That *is* weird.

DARIA:  Yep.  Though after seeing my mom make decorative coasters 
last night, I'm ready for anything.

(The music starts to play.  It's soft, very similar to the music for 
the jingle in "The Lawndale File."  After a few seconds, we hear 
Trent singing.)

TRENT:
		Jane she's pretty cool,
		A real cool cat.
		She goes to high school,
		Ain't nothin' beat that...

(More guitar strumming.  Daria and Jodie stare at Jane.  Jane shrugs.)

JANE:  So it's not Shakespeare.

TRENT:
		You gotta be a fool
		If you-don't-vote-for-her.  So... (sudden loud strumming.)

		VOTE VOTE VOTE FOR JANE!!!
		VOTE VOTE VOTE FOR JANE!!!

(Daria and Jodie are now cringing.  Jane looks uneasy, as though 
she's regretting her decision to play the song.)

TRENT:

		VOTE VOTE VOTE FOR JANE!!!
		VOTE VOTE VOTE FOR JANE!!!

(Cut to shot of Quinn in the hall.  Like the other students, she's 
transfixed.  Wears a horrified expression on her face.)

TRENT:
		YOU'LL DRIVE ME *INSANE*
		IF YOU DON'T VOTE FOR JANE!!!  (more guitar strumming.)

(Quinn puts a hand to her forehead.)

QUINN:  Oh God, *no*!

(She suddenly realizes that Sandi is standing next to her, smirking 
at her obvious humiliation.  Quinn lamely tries to recover.)

QUINN:  Um, I mean: oh no, I hope this isn't the *only* time we get 
to hear this song.

SANDI: (not convinced)  Uh-huh.

(She and Quinn exchange predatory smiles.)

TRENT:
		Jane she's pretty cool,
		She goes to high school.
		You gotta be a fool
		If you don't vote vote vote vote  (loud strumming.)

		VOTE VOTE VOTE FOR JANE!!!
		VOTE VOTE VOTE FOR JANE!!!
		VOTE VOTE VOTE FOR JANE!!!

		VOTE VOTE VOTE VOTE
		VOTE VOTE VOTE VOTE
		JANE, JANE, JANE, JANE, JAAAAAAAANE!!!
		(one final strum, then silence.)

(Cut to shot of Jane, Daria, and Jodie.  Jane cringes slightly, 
looking amused and embarrassed.  Suddenly the people around them 
start cheering.)

(Cut to shot of Quinn and Sandi.  The people near them have started 
cheering, too.  In response, Sandi's expression changes from 
triumphant to shocked.  Quinn looks relieved.  Resume shot of Jane, 
Daria, and Jodie, looking bewildered.)

MS. LI: (over the P.A.)  Yes, yes, that was a lovely song.  Now 
quickly allow your anarchic excitement to die down, or I'll sic the 
riot squad on you.  That is all.

(Pause.  We then see Brittany running up to Jane, Daria, and Jodie, 
waving her pom-poms.)

BRITTANY:  Wow, Jane, that sounded just like my cheer.  Go, Jane, 
*go*!  Yeah!!!!  (jumps up in the air.)

(Before Jane can respond, Brittany runs off.  Then Kevin appears.)

KEVIN: (goofy cheerful)  Hey Jane, cool song.  And *catchy*.  "Vote 
vote vote vote vote... vote... vote..." (looks at Jane for help.)

JANE:  For *Jane*.

KEVIN:  Oh yeah!  I got it!  (flashes a thumbs up, then runs off.)

(Meanwhile, Daria looks like her usual impassive self, and Jodie is smirking.)

JANE: (amused and exasperated)  Geez, who'd've thought Trent could 
write such a crowd pl--

(Just then Sandi waltzes past, wearing a typical condescending smirk.)

SANDI:  *Cute* song.  (Bt)  If the rest of your campaign is as good, 
this might *almost* be a race.

(Jane frowns as she disappears offscreen.  Pause.)

JANE: (hushed)  Don't underestimate me, Sandi.

(fade-out.  fade-in to: )

SCENE 2 (Lane house, that afternoon)

(Shot of the outside.  Cut to shot of Jane, Daria, and Jodie seated 
at the kitchen table.  Jodie's holding a notepad for writing down the 
campaign ideas Jane has.  So far, her notepad is almost blank.)

JANE:  Okay, okay... how 'bout this?  Mandatory art classes for all students.

(Daria says nothing, but instead looks at Jodie to see her response. 
She's nixed the last several of Jane's ideas.)

JODIE	: (neutral-toned)  Uh-huh.

JANE:  None of your cutting art to make more room for the three R's 
-- *no* sir!  It's my belief that if we *all* took more art classes, 
we'd lose that aggressiveness that's made Western Civilization *so* 
unpleasant these past few centuries.  Then we'd stop competing with 
each other, there'd be no more cliques, and our school would be a 
better place.  Problems solved.  (brushes her hands together in a 
satisfied manner.)

JODIE:  Um, uh-huh.  (the notepad remains blank.)

(Beat)

JANE: (sensing her lack of enthusiasm.  with slight exasperation) 
Now what's wrong with *that*?

(Beat)

JODIE:  Nothing, Jane.  But... I'm just not sure it's practical.

DARIA: (to Jodie.  sardonic)  Do tell.

JODIE:  First of all, I doubt you could convince the school board to 
increase our art funding.  Not when we're using history text books 
from 1967.

JANE:  Hmm, yeah -- that explains why we're so obsessed with 
Communism around here.  No one seems to realize the Soviet Union fell 
almost *ten* years ago.

JODIE:  Right.  (Bt)  Second, it doesn't seem like something that 
could really address the needs of the student body.  It's sort of a 
"feel-good" solution.

JANE:  Hmm... yeah.  (looks sort of distressed.  flops back in her 
chair.)  Well then what *should* my message to the students be??  I'm 
fresh out of ideas.

(Jodie pauses to think.)

DARIA: (to Jane)  Why even have a message?  Just telling the students 
you won't sic the fashion police on them should be enough.

JANE: (exasperated)  *Should* be -- but for some twisted reason, they 
seem to look *up* to Sandi.  I wanna know how I can work *around* 
that.

JODIE:  Well, I found during my campaign for vice-president that just 
listening to the students' problems went a long way toward gaining 
their trust.

JANE: (like it's a foreign concept)  Listening??  You mean like... I 
ask, they tell?  (Jodie nods.)  And that *works*?

JODIE:  You'd be surprised.  (Bt)  When Dean was president, he left a 
lot of students to be ignored.  I bet most of them would love to 
spill their guts to you.

JANE: (smirking)  Then I could be their hero.  I like that.

(Beat)

DARIA:  But how can you be so sure *Dean* didn't start out with that attitude?

JANE:  Please, Daria, the guy was a corrupt grade-changing shark who 
didn't give a damn about anything beyond himself.  (Bt)  Whereas I'd 
at least be *real* to my fellow classmates.

DARIA: (wrinkling her nose)  Real??  You think playing Oprah is your 
way of being real?

(Jodie rolls her eyes at Daria's tone -- she's been a pessimist all 
afternoon.  Jane looks at Daria with a peevish expression.)

JANE:  Well *why* not??  I can listen as well as the next guy.  They 
talk, I say "uh-huh."  No *sweat*.

DARIA:  If you say so.

(Beat)

JANE:  Hey, Jodie?  That reminds me: um, how d' you keep from looking 
*bored* when others talk to you?

(fade-out.  fade-in to: )

SCENE 3 (Lawndale High, the next day -- first day of "Jane Lane's 
Listening Tour")

(Shot of the outside.  Shot of some students lying on the grass near 
the parking lot.  We see Jane approach them with an unusual degree of 
awkwardness.  Jodie and Daria follow.)

JANE:  Um... *hey*, guys.

(Pause.  The students look up at her, wearing expressions that range 
from impassive to confused.)

JANE:  Um, I don't suppose you'd know me.  I'm Jane Lane.

(Pause.  No response.)

JANE:  I'm... running for student body president?

(Pause.  Jane glances back at Jodie for guidance.  Jodie gives her a 
nod that says, "You're doing fine.  Keep going."  Just then, one of 
the students shows signs of awareness.)

MALE STUDENT:  Oh yeah.  Aren't you the one who painted the gym to
look like some guy's car crash?
[*] see "Daria Dance Party"

JANE: (relieved)  Guilty as charged.

FEMALE STUDENT:  That was really creepy.

JANE:  Thanks!  (Bt.  sighs, knowing the girl didn't mean that in a 
humorous way.)  Look, I'm a pretty normal person, honest.  Don't 
believe the lies the school psychiatrist tells you.

(Pause.  The students frown.)

JANE:  I'm kidding.  (Bt)  The reason I'm here, in fact, is to show 
you that I'm not your typical ivory tower candidate.  I've spent my 
whole student career as an outsider, so I know how it feels to not be 
heard.  So if you have any complaints, problems about the school, I'm 
the one to talk to.

(Pause)

MALE STUDENT: (doubtful)  And you'll help us?

JANE:  I'll try my best.

(Beat.  The students look at each other, their faces brightening.)

FEMALE STUDENT:  So if I asked you to do something about the lack of 
toilet paper in the women's bathrooms, you would?

(Jane, Jodie, and Daria all cringe, understanding her problem.)

JANE:  *Ugh*, you bet.

MALE STUDENT:  And you'd convince Ms. Li to change her "no T-shirts 
with subversive logos" policy?

JANE:  I could probably arrange something.

FEMALE STUDENT 2:  And you'll ask them to clean the gum out of the 
drinking fountains?

MALE STUDENT:  Or to replace the textbooks that have no front *or* back cover??

JANE:  Ugh, *yes*.  (Bt.  amazed)  Boy, I didn't realize what a
crappy school we went to.  I'll look into everything.

FEMALE STUDENT 2:  Great!

MALE STUDENT:  I already like you better than Dean McBale.

JANE: (smirking)  Just remember that on election day.  (Bt.  turns to 
Daria and Jodie.)  Hey, these're starting to add up.  Do either of 
you have something I could use to write them down?

(Daria shrugs, empty-handed.  Jodie starts to pull something out, 
when we see a hand reach over from offscreen with a pad and pen. 
Jane frowns.)

UPCHUCK: (offscreen)  Allow me, luscious Jane.  (pan over to show him.)

JANE: (backing away)  Forget it, Upchuck.  I'd sooner pick a notebook 
out of the trash than touch something that's had contact with *your* 
body.

UPCHUCK:  Grrrrrrrr... feisty!  I *like* that in my female presidents!

JANE:  Then you'll *love* the swift kick in the groin I'm about to give you.

UPCHUCK: (cringing a little)  Uh -- but don't I get to tell you *my* problem?

(Beat.  Jane sighs heavily.)

JANE:  *Yes*.

UPCHUCK:  Ahhhh... (rubs his hands together with anticipation.)  My 
problem is that there are *so* many fine ladies, and only *one* 
little me.  Can you talk Ms. Li into letting me clone myself in the 
science room?

(Beat)

JANE:  I would, Upchuck, but I think even Ms. Li would be against 
unleashing a plague on the student body.

(Her response is met with mild laughter.)

JANE:  Find a good laboratory that's looking for experimental subjects instead.

UPCHUCK: (looking defeated, but impressed)  Grrrrrrrr... even when 
she repels, she *attracts*!  Grrrrrrr...

(He leaves.  Jane slaps a hand to her forehead, then sees Daria 
cocking a droll eyelid at her.)

JANE:  Boy, this listening stuff is harder than it looks.

(From offscreen: )

SANDI: (calling out)  You know, some believe that those who just 
*listen* don't have anything to *say*.

(Jane, Daria, and Jodie turn to look.  Cut to shot of Sandi lounging 
on the hood of her car in the parking lot, surrounded by yet more 
admiring students.  Jane walks over to them.)

JANE: (folding her arms)  Really?  And which esteemed scholar coined 
*that* expression?

SANDI:  My mother.  (Bt)  She taught me that the only way to be a 
*true* leader is to be *persuasive*.

JANE: (sardonic)  A visionary?

(Daria and Jodie come over.)

DARIA: (deadpan)  Which must be why the Fashion Club is the 
cutting-edge institution it is today.

SANDI: (missing the sarcasm)  *Exactly*.  (Bt.  looks pointedly at 
Jane.)  And if you can't take the heat, maybe you should get out of 
the, um... sun, or *something*.

(Several members of her entourage laugh.)

MALE STUDENT:  *Good* one, Sandi.

(Sandi smirks at him like a dog owner who's pleased that her pet has 
performed the right trick.)

JANE: (exasperated)  Okay, Sandi.  So what exactly *are* the big 
schemes you've designed to dig a hole and bury me in it?

(Sandi shudders, and glares at her.)

SANDI:  You don't have to get *gross* about it.  But since you 
asked... (knowing glance at her entourage) what d' you say to 
*four*-hour school days?  Or to being able to *fire* the teachers you 
don't like??

ENTOURAGE:  Ooh!!!

JANE:  I'd say great -- if I thought it could work.

SANDI: (smirking)  Oh, it'll *work*, all right.

JODIE: (annoyed)  The president doesn't have the authority to do that, Sandi.

SANDI:  Maybe not *now*, but when *I* assume the position --

DARIA:  No one will resist?  No guys, anyway.

SANDI: (not getting it)  Uh... yeah.

JODIE:  Sandi, being president won't give you powers that not even 
the *school board* has.

SANDI: (getting defensive)  How do *you* know?  Maybe all it *takes* 
is the *right* person to do --

JANE:  Okay, well let's say you *do* manage to enact a plan that lets 
the students fire teachers they don't like.  Say one kid decided to 
fire a teacher who'd made his life a living hell.  But the problem 
is, that same teacher who *he* hated turned out to be another 
student's only link to sanity.

(Beat.  Sandi watches her blankly.)

JANE:  And when that teacher left, the student snapped, and decided 
to take out his revenge not *only* on the kid who'd *fired* the 
teacher, but on every student who'd ever looked at him the wrong way.

(We hear a collective gasp from the crowd, and see many students get 
fearful expressions.  Daria looks subtly impressed by the way Jane 
took command of the situation.  Jodie, too, appears pleased. 
Meanwhile, Sandi looks a little freaked out.  Then she glares at 
Jane.)

SANDI:  *Weirdo*.  You know that would never happen.

JANE:  Don't be so sure about that, Sandi.

SANDI:  *Why*?  Is it something *you've* been planning??

(At this, Jane frowns.  Daria and Jodie also frown darkly.)

DARIA:  *Hey*, Sandi --

JANE: (maintaining her cool)  Just where d' you come up with *that* idea?

SANDI:  'Cause only a *freaky* Goth chick like you could be *that* screwed-up.

JANE: (slowly losing her cool)  I prefer Gothic *art* chic, thank you.

SANDI: (smirking)  Whoops.  Sorry.  Don't want to *upset* you.

(She glances at the members of her entourage, several of whom respond 
with nervous giggles.)

JODIE: (eyes narrowing)  Don't listen to her, Jane.

JANE: (irritated)  Look, Sandi, I've had just about *enough* --

(Suddenly, from offscreen: )

QUINN: (chipper)  Hi, you guys!

(She saunters onscreen, casts a pointed, irresistible look at the 
male members of Sandi's entourage, then walks away.  A large number 
of the guys look as though they're struggling between staying with 
Sandi or going after her.  Finally they break away and run after 
Quinn.  Cut to shot of Quinn and the guys.)

QUINN: (tossing her hair.  innocent tone)  Y' know, I was thinking: 
wouldn't it be really *cool* if Jane Lane was president?

GUYS:  Uh-huh!!

(Sandi forgets what she and Jane were fighting about, and watches 
this exchange with a shocked expression.  Jane smirks with relief.)

(fade-out.  fade-in to: )

SCENE 4 (school hallway, Monday the following week)

(Shot of Jane and Daria at their lockers.  They're acting like their
usual selves, but there's  definite tension between them.  While Jane 
fiddles around in her locker, Daria reads the underground newspaper. 
Just then, Jodie comes up to them with the school paper in hand.)

JODIE:  Hey Jane, don't feel discouraged: the Lowdown says you're 
starting to creep up on Sandi in the polls.

JANE:  I am??  (looks at the article to which Jodie's pointing, gets 
an amazed look on her face.)

JODIE:  It says a lot of people really like that you're bothering to 
listen to them.  And that they've found holes in Sandi's so-called 
"vision" for the school.

JANE:  Well I'll be damned.  (Bt)  You know it's funny that Ms. Li 
hasn't caught whiff of her schemes.

JODIE:  She probably doesn't take them seriously.

JANE:  This is Ms. *Li* we're talking about.

DARIA:  More likely she knows Sandi's popular, so she cuts her slack 
she wouldn't you.

JANE: (brow wrinkling with concern)  Hmmm...

JODIE:  Well anyway, your outsider approach also seems to be 
affecting how students see you.

(Daria cocks a wary eyelid at the word, "approach.")

JODIE: (to Jane)  You don't come across as one of the elitists. 
You're down-to-earth.  People are starting to see you as a force of 
change.

JANE:  Well zippidy-doo-dah --  I feel like celebrating!  This loner 
art chick's proving to the world that she's not gonna lie down an' 
fade away.

JODIE: (smiling)  Easy, there: don't celebrate too soon.  You've 
still got a lot of people to talk to, and then there's the speech you 
have to give on election day.

JANE: (pumped-up)  Well bring it *on* -- I'm ready for anything. 
(Bt)  Say, Daria, any news about my surge in the underground paper?

(Pause)

DARIA:  Hmm... nope.  Not a word.  (Bt)  Although there *is* this 
article about a girl who thought she could beat the popular crowd, 
but instead she let herself be turned into them.

(Pause.  Jodie and Jane pick up on Daria's subtle meaning and frown.)

(fade-out.  fade-in to: )

SCENE 5 (lunchtime, later that day)

(Shot of Jodie walking with Jane through the cafeteria.)

JODIE:  Don't let her get to you.

JANE:  You mean Daria and her incurable self-righteousness??  (rolls 
her eyes and sighs.)  I'm trying *not* to, but it's hard when your 
best friend won't support you on something that's important.

(Jodie nods with understanding.)

JODIE:  It could be she's just jealous.  You know, 'cause you had the
courage to run for office and she didn't.

(Jane shrugs.)

JANE:  Yeah, maybe so.  (Bt.  frowns)  Though this isn't the *first* 
time she's rained on my parade.

JODIE:  Look, Jane, I know Daria's your best friend, and her opinions 
mean a lot to you.  But if you want to do what you need to for this 
election, you may just have to ignore her.

(Beat)

JANE: (resigned)  Yeah.  You're right.

(Cut to shot of a table of nerds.  Jane and Jodie approach them.)

JANE: (hushed)  This listening stuff is still a little weird to me. 
So's spouting campaign soundbites.  It just doesn't feel quite real. 
(Bt. half-joking)  You sure *you* wouldn't rather run in my place?

JODIE: (hushed)  You're doing fine.  I know sound bites suck, but 
they're a necessary evil in politics.

(Jane nods, then glances at the nerds and makes a throat-clearing 
sound.  The nerds look up at her.)

JANE: (mustering a cheerful tone)  Hey guys, the name's Jane Lane and 
I'm running for student body president.  I'm here to listen so if 
you've got a problem, any problem, I'm your girl.

(Pause.  The nerds look at each other questioningly.  Suddenly one 
gets up -- one we recognize as Barry from "'Shipped Out."  He looks 
enraged, and points a finger at Jane accusingly.)

BARRY: (squeaky Corey voice)  Don't believe her, men!  This woman set 
me up with that foul temptress, Daria Morgendorffer!  (to Jane)  Oh 
you'll pay.  You'll paaaaaaaaay!

(Jane looks at Jodie and groans.)

(fade-out.  fade-into: )

SCENE 6 (the next day, the first of a montage of scenes taking place 
throughout the week)

(The toned-down portion of the music from Jane's campaign song plays 
throughout this montage.  Shot of Jane standing on the volleyball 
court in the midst of a gym class game.  She's surrounded by curious 
students, to whom she's talking with much more confidence than the 
day before.  Keeps making exaggerated gestures to illustrate her 
points.  Meanwhile Daria stands in the background, impassive.)

JANE:  ... And when I *say* I'm here to hear, I *mean* I'm here to 
hear, 'cause I know what it's like to not be listened to.  (pauses 
momentarily to hit a flying volleyball back over the net without so 
much as looking at it.)  Heck, I'll even listen to *you*!  (looks 
pointedly offscreen.)

(Pan over to show Andrea sitting in the bleachers.  She stares back 
at Jane blankly.  Resume shot of Jane.)

JANE:  See, like the rest of you, I, too, feel like I'm not being 
heard by the powers-that-be at the top of the food chain.  Which is 
why I'm determined to be the *first* candidate who truly cares --

(Cut to close-up of Daria.  She rolls her eyes.  fade-out.)

(fade-in to shot of Sandi heading out the door of one of the school
buildings in the direction of the quad.  She suddenly freezes and 
gets a shocked look on her face - cut to her POV.  We see Jane 
sitting at a table littered with various art supplies, in the midst 
of painting a student's face and listening his problems.  Behind the 
student is a line of other students that looks about a mile long. 
Several people who've already had their faces painted are standing 
nearby, gazing at each other, and Jane, admiringly.  Resume close-up 
of Sandi.  Her shock has been replaced by irritation, and as she 
slowly turns around to go back inside, she continues to watch the 
activity in the quad with a dark frown.)

(Cut to close-up of Jane.  She's been sitting at the table, painting 
and listening to the students for a long time.  Her expression is now 
one of weary cheerfulness.  As she nods her head to the one student's 
voice, she peers out at the long, long line behind him.  Closes her 
eyes, gets a "Why me?" look on her face.  fade-out.)

(fade-in to shot of Jane walks down the hall with a group of students 
that's smaller, yet similar to the entourage Sandi had in Act One.)

MALE STUDENT: (to Jane)  You'll get them to serve vegan in the cafeteria?

FEMALE STUDENT:  You'll make sure they install private showers in the
locker rooms?

JANE: (enthused)  I'll do my best.  Remember: when you're listened 
to, you're already halfway to the final results.  (pumps a fist for 
emphasis.)

STUDENTS:  Cool!

(They pass by Ms. Li and Mrs. Manson, the school psychologist.  Pause 
shot on the two of them.)

MANSON: (hushed)  Don't you find the messages she espouses to be *disturbing*?

MS. LI: (unusually non-chalant)  Oh fiddle-faddle!  It's just good 
clean student fun!

(fade-out.  fade-in to shot of Jane, sitting on one of the desks in 
DeMartino's classroom, some time after class.  DeMartino stands over 
her, lecturing, while Jane watches him with a wary expression.)

DeMARTINO:  My only hope, Candidate LANE, is that you've *absorbed* 
enough of my TEACHING to understand how to be a *good* civic LEADER --

(Just then, O'Neill passes by the open door of the classroom, his 
face red and eyes teary.  Looks inside, sees Jane.)

O'NEILL: (wailing)  I need someone to listen to me!!!

(He rushes toward her.  Jane cringes, jumps off the desk, and looks 
at her watch.)

JANE:  *Whoops*!  I'd love to but -- gotta go!

(She runs off.  DeMartino's eye bulges and he frowns in a "surprise, 
surprise" manner.  Then he glances uneasily at the whimpering Mr. 
O'Neill.  fade-out.)

(fade-in to shot of Jane sitting on the grass, listening to a student 
wrap up a summary of financial problems.)

MALE STUDENT:  It was really nice of you to sit here so long.

JANE: (sober)  Hey, it's no problem.  Maybe I can help.

MALE STUDENT: (grateful)  Thanks, but I think it'd take a miracle for 
me to afford that kind of tutoring.

JANE:  Yeah, well, you may have just met the miracle worker.

(fade-out.  fade-in to: )

SCENE 7 (hallway)

(Music ends.  Shot of two guys passing out T-shirts and buttons 
bearing the same funky design as the one on Jane's posters.  Over the 
design reads the message: "I'm here to hear."  In the background, we 
hear the muffled sounds of Jane talking.  From offscreen: )

SANDI:  Just what the *hell* do you think you're doing?!

(The guys get shocked looks on their faces and drop the stuff on the 
ground.  Sandi walks up to them with a stormy expression on her 
face.)

GUYS:  Uh...

SANDI:  You were *supposed* to be passing out stuff for *my* 
campaign, not for that *loser's*.

GUYS:  But uh... Q-Quinn said...

SANDI: (eyes narrowing)  *Quinn*.

(She marches away, in Quinn's direction.  On the way, she sees 
Brooke, the wanna-be F.C., also passing out Jane's stuff.  Brooke 
catches site of Sandi's evil eye and cringes guiltily.  We then see 
Sandi head toward Quinn, who's cheerfully standing off to the 
sidelines, passing out more buttons.  She sees Sandi and smirks.)

QUINN: (chipper)  Hi, Sandi!  Good luck on election day!

(Sandi can't reply -- she just stalks away and stands by another part 
of the crowd.  We see a lot of familiar faces, including Kevin, 
Brittany, and Mack, as well as Jodie and Daria, who aren't standing 
together.  Jodie's watching Jane with approval, Daria with her usual 
impassiveness.  Jane's standing on a chair, talking to some of the 
students.)

JANE:  ... Well sure I can look into it, I don't see why not.  I mean 
like I've been saying all along, I'm here for *you*.  Isn't that what 
the president's all about??

(Mild clapping from the audience, and several pleased looks.  Nearby 
Daria, we see a hyper-charged Kevin and Brittany.)

KEVIN: (to Brittany)  Hey, babe, you think Jane'll give the football 
players special parking spots outside of homeroom?  Y' know, for in 
case we, like, oversleep or somethin'.

BRITTANY:  Let's ask her, Kevvy!

(Daria watches this exchange, and slowly raises her hand.)

DARIA: (to Jane)  Um, excuse me?

(Pause.  Jane stops talking and looks at Daria.)

JANE: (somewhat wary)  Yeah... Daria?

DARIA:  You seem to be promising many things to many different 
students.  How do you propose to carry out these promises?

(Beat.  Jane glances with some uncertainty in Jodie's direction.)

JANE:  Well we sort've talked... she thought --

DARIA: (pointed look)  What do *you* plan to do?

(Pause.  Jane rolls her eyes.)

JANE: (defensive)  How can I have a plan when I haven't even been 
*elected* yet?

DARIA:  Easy.  You could be studying the powers of the office right 
now.  Or forming alliances with some of the less hostile faculty 
members so you'll have backup support.

(Jodie wears a resigned expression as she listens to yet another 
example of Daria's pessimism.  Sandi cocks an amused brow at Jane's 
obvious discomfort.)

JANE:  I could still do those things -- the election's still a ways 
away.  (Bt.  sarcastic)  But thanks for the ideas, *pal*: wish I 
could've heard them a while ago.

DARIA:  No problem.  (Bt)  I'm just sorry *I* had to be the one to 
come up with them.

(Jane looks even more annoyed.  Cut to close-up of Sandi, looking satisfied.)

(fade-out.  fade-in to: )

SCENE 8 (Griffin house, that afternoon)

(Shot of the outside.  Cut to close-up of Sandi, now gazing downward 
and frowning.  Cut to wider shot: she's standing in the living room, 
school paper in hand, while Linda is seated on the coach.  Sandi 
takes one last look at the paper, then flings it down.)

SANDI:  *Stupid* school poll.  I can't believe I've lost my *stupid* lead.

LINDA: (smug)  Sandi, I *warned* you what would happen if you grew complacent.

(Sandi looks at her mom with an extremely frustrated expression.)

SANDI:  But I *wasn't*!  I've been, like, *totally* into this election stuff!

LINDA:  If you *say* so.  But the *point* is, now that you're down, 
are you just going to lie there like an old *dog*?  Or are you going 
to *do* something?

SANDI: (glaring at her)  'Course I'm gonna *do* something!  There's 
still enough *time*.  (Bt)  The only reason I didn't do enough 
*earlier* is 'cause I felt *sorry* for that Gothic nobody.

LINDA:  Felt *sorry* for her?  (Bt.  rolls her eyes.  with 
condescension and something approaching affection.)  *Sandi*, pity 
makes you weak.  Haven't you *learned* that by now??

(Sandi rolls her eyes.)

LINDA:  Don't you remember what happened the *last* time you felt 
sorry for someone?

(Pause.  Sandi now gets a resentful, sheepish look on her face.  Her 
mom can really twist a knife.)

LINDA:  You thought that girl would *never* catch up, and now she 
has.  Do you want her to *beat* you??
 
SANDI: (sober)  No.  (Bt)  From now on, I'll show that freak what I'm 
*really* all about.

LINDA: (satisfied)  Thatta girl.

SANDI:  First I'm gonna have to find out who's still *loyal* to me. 
Thanks to that Jane and *Quinn*, I'm losing support... and that's 
*not* how it's supposed to be.  *Jane's* the one who should be down 
and out, not *me*.  (Pause)  So I'm just gonna have to get dirt on 
her.



****************
END OF ACT TWO

[Shot of Jane hitting a volleyball back over the net while she's 
giving her campaign talk.]


***You are now entering commercial *HELL*.  Please keep your seatbelt 
securely fastened.  You are about to see some of the lamest 
commercials put on television.***

1)  Those exercise machine commercials: the ones which show some 
super-buffed guy or super-toned woman and claim that you, too, can be 
buffed if you use the blahbedy-blah machine.  Yeah... for ten hours a
day.

2)  Viagra: yes, it's nice that old men can rev up their libidos by 
popping a pill... but the commercial confuses that with *love*.  It 
shows a bunch of attractive middle-aged men walking confidently up to 
the women and taking them into their arms.  Ooh, how romantic... 
except that most women could tell you that increased sexual prowess 
doesn't make them *love* their partners any better.

Anyway, I'm sick of hearing about Viagra.  Viagra... Viagra... 
Viagra... Viagra... Viagra... Bob Dole... Viagra... Viagra... 
Viagra... Viagra.....

3)  Speaking of sex... here's a perfect commercial to show during a 
TV program geared toward teenagers: Allysa Milano, or a look-alike, 
lounging on the bed in lingerie, assuming various erotic poses. 
Meanwhile, her half-naked boyfriend ignores the mountains of condoms 
in his medicine chest in favor of Candie's fragrance, which he 
squirts -- guess where??  There's an appealing tongue-in-cheek tone 
to this ad, but it doesn't overcome the tackiness.

***You are now leaving commercial *HELL*. Aren't you happy you survived?***


ACT THREE

SCENE 1 (Lawndale High, the next day)

(Shot of the outside.  Cut to shot of Daria standing at her locker, 
wearing an impassive expression.  Jane strides up to her, holding a 
copy of the school paper.)

JANE: (mustering enthusiasm)  Hey!  Did you hear??  I'm tied with Sandi!

(Pause)

DARIA: (deadpan)  Congratulations.

(Beat)

JANE: (trying to pump her up)  And if momentum stays on my side, you 
could be looking at the new student body president in a week.  Just 
think of *that*, huh?  Just *imagine* how we could shake things up 
around here once I get in a position of power.

(Beat)

DARIA:  Yeah.

(Beat.  Jane gives up trying to appeal to her.  Tosses her hands in 
the air, gets a peevish, somewhat resentful look on her face.)

JANE: (quiet, awkward)  Look, Daria, I don't ask much from you as a 
friend.  But couldn't you at least *try* to show some enthusiasm for 
me?

(Beat)

DARIA: (picking up on Jane's tone, but still deadpan)  Sure.

(Beat)

JANE: (annoyed)  No, you're not sure.  What's wrong?  (Bt)  Are you 
weirded out 'cause I've been spending so much time with Jodie?

(Daria shrugs, looks slightly uncomfortable.)

DARIA:  I'm weirded out by a lot of things.  Your whole running for 
president is weird.

JANE: (rolling her eyes)  'Cause it's not something Jane Lane's 
supposed to do??

DARIA:  More like something you don't know how to do.  So far, all 
you've been doing is spouting the things *Jodie* wants you to say.

JANE: (defensive)  Hey, c' mon -- Jodie's a pro at this election 
stuff.  Why shouldn't I follow some of her suggestions?

DARIA:  Maybe 'cause you should be coming up with your own ideas.  It 
*is* your campaign.

JANE:  Hey, I've *got* ideas.

DARIA:  Name one.

(Jane pauses for a moment, reflects, then looks at Daria with a 
frustrated expression.)

JANE:  I *can't* when you're making me all nervous.

(Beat.  Daria cocks an eyelid.)

DARIA:  What's more, I haven't been able to figure out your reason 
for running.  Other than sheer and utter vanity -- which I was hoping 
you didn't have.

JANE: (sarcastic)  Could it be because I *care* about the students?

DARIA: (can't resist the urge to smirk)  Care about the students?? 
 From which T.V. show?

(Beat.  Jane rolls her eyes.)

JANE:  I know you think it's a far-fetched concept -- *me* caring 
about anyone beyond our privileged circle.  But believe it or not, 
this campaign *has* taught me a lot about the student body.  I *do* 
want to help people out.

(Beat.  Daria shrugs, concedes this point.)

JANE:  But maybe that's what's really bugging you.  If I'm less 
alienated, then that could mean *you'll* have to become less 
alienated -- and maybe you're not ready for that.  Maybe you're too 
afraid.

(Beat.  Daria responds by quietly shutting her locker.  She turns to 
Jane, wearing a serious expression.)

DARIA:  If I'm afraid of anything, it's of what's gonna happen to you 
if you *do* get elected president.   If you're so easily influenced 
by someone like Jodie, I'd hate to think how you'd handle the 
pressures put on you by Ms. Li or the popular crowd.

(Beat)

JANE:  Them??  (Bt.  chuckles with disbelief.)  Jodie's a *friend*, 
Daria.  They're... (cringes) *not*.  I know who my enemies are, and 
*believe* me, I won't let myself get swayed by any of them.  I *told* 
you I'd try and change things if I got elected.

(Beat)

DARIA:  I really hope so, Jane.

(She and Jane look at each other for a split second longer.  Then 
Daria shrugs a "good bye" and walks away.  Jane watches her go, 
trying not to look worried.)

(fade-out.  fade-in to: )

SCENE 2 (computer lab)

(Shot of the door as seen from the outside.  Cut to inside shot.  We 
see Barry seated at one of the computers, looking nervous -- 
primarily because Sandi's hovering over him, viewing what's on the 
screen.  She doesn't look happy.)

SANDI: (irritated)  *Six* hours of hacking her file and this is *all* 
you could come *up* with?  "Academic probation"??

BARRY: (quavering)  I-I tried, Sandi, I *really*, really tried...

SANDI: (eyes narrowing)  Be *quiet*.  (Bt)  I guess I'll have to 
resort to my *own* devices.

BARRY:  B-but will you still p-promise to support my --

SANDI: (icy)  *Dead* animals society??  Perhaps.  (Bt)  I might need 
your *nerd* powers again in the *not*-too-distant future.  But for 
*now*, I think I'll visit Ms. *Li* an' see what *she* might
volunteer....

(And with that, Sandi strides out of the computer lab.)

(cut to: )
 
SCENE 3 (Ms. Li's office)

(Shot of the door as seen from the outside.  We see Sandi walk up to 
it normally, then pause, almost as though she's reluctant to go ahead 
with what she's planning.  Finally she tosses her hair in a "carpe 
diem" manner and opens the door.  Cut to shot of the inside.  Ms. Li 
doesn't notice that Sandi's walked in.  She's absorbed in a phone 
conversation, and is turned toward the back wall.)

MS. LI:  *Yes*, Mrs. Griffin, pleeeese go on...

(Upon hearing that, Sandi gets a shocked look on her face.  Cut to 
shot of Ms. Li, which becomes a split-screen diagonal -- Ms. Li on 
the left, Linda Griffin on the right.)

LINDA: (no-nonsense)   The order for the new *basketball* uniforms 
went on my account, the new security lights should be there next
week, *and* I've arranged for the T.V. station where I work to flash 
"Lawndale High rules" onscreen every ten seconds.  Is that *enough*?

(Ms. Li is impressed, but tries to conceal it.  Bobs her head back 
and forth in consideration.)

MS. LI:  Hmmm... hmmm... veeery nice, except for *one* thing.  What 
about getting Helen Morgendorffer to participate in the charity 
raffle?

LINDA: (superior smirk)  I'm *way* ahead of you.  The poor thing's 
been making decorative coasters for *two* weeks.

MS. LI: (amazed)  But-but *how*??

LINDA:  It's amazing what a little info about someone's *marriage* 
problems can do.

MS. LI: (can barely conceal her glee)  M-marriage problems... oh-ho, 
you're *good*, Mrs. Griffin!  That'll *teach* her to be allergic to 
crepe paper!
[*] see "Just Add Water"

LINDA:  She actually *used* that excuse?

MS. LI:  Ohhhhhh *yes*.  (Bt)  God, how I *hate* that woman!

LINDA:  Don't we all, Ms. Li.  Don't we all.

(They share a sinister chuckle.)

MS. LI:  Well you've more than held up *your* end of the bargain. 
Come election day, the ballot boxes will be stuffed with your 
daughter's -- (turns around, sees Sandi.  gets a shocked look on her 
face.)  *Oh*!  Ho-ho-ho, Ms. *Griffin*!!  I didn't, um, *see* you... 
there.

(Cut to shot of her and Sandi.  The shock has died from her face, and 
has been replaced by dull anger.)

SANDI: (flat)  What're you and my *mother* talking about?

MS. LI:  Oh-ho, *just* --

SANDI: (eyes narrowing)  Well would you, like, be *kind* enough to 
give her a message from me?  (Bt)  Tell her to stay the *hell* out of
this.  She thinks it's her *right* to, like, bail me out whenever I'm 
in *trouble*.  Well this time it's *different*.

MS. LI: (pacifying)  Oh *now*, Ms. Griffin --

SANDI:  I'm gonna win this *stupid* election on my own, so *don't* do 
me any goddamn *favors*.

(Without waiting for Ms. Li's reply, she bolts out of the office, 
slamming the door behind her.  Ms. Li watches her go with chagrin, 
then returns her attention to the phone.)

MS. LI: (to Linda)  So do I still get to keep the security lights?

(fade-out.  fade-in to: )

SCENE 4 (hallway, a couple days later)

(Shot of Jane walking along.  Nearby we see several people standing 
around, whispering.  They keep giving Jane timid looks.  Jane puts on 
her election face and makes a move to talk to them, but their body 
language suggests that they'd rather be left alone.  Confused, Jane 
shrugs and continues walking.  We then see Jodie come toward her from
the opposite direction.  She, too, notices the looks and whispers, 
and frowns.)

JODIE:  Looks like the rumor mill's been started up.  By Guess Who?

JANE: (sardonic)  Surprise, surprise.  (Bt)  But how bad could any 
rumors about me *be*??  People already know I'm an outsider -- that's 
been my whole platform.

JODIE:  Well whatever it is, hopefully it'll pass.

(Jane nods, then glances again at all the whispering people.  Tries 
to seem non-chalant, but can't help but look uneasy.)

(fade-out.  fade-in to: )

SCENE 5 (cafeteria, lunchtime)

(Shot of the tables, students eating and milling around.  Jane walks 
onscreen, still looking noticeably uneasy.  She goes over to a random 
table and musters some of the campaign cheerfulness .)

JANE:  Hey guys -- remember what's coming up soon??  Election day!
Who're ya gonna vote for??

(Pause.  The students just sit there quietly and give Jane an odd 
expression.  Jane takes the hint, turns away.)

JANE: (hushed.  annoyed)  I'll have my humble pie a la mode, thank you.

(She heaves a sigh -- by now she's thoroughly sick of sucking up to 
people, not that she ever liked it in the first place.  After a few 
moments of indecision, Jane decides to try another table , hoping to 
get a different response.)

JANE:  Hey, you guys, on election day, remember the student who 
actually *listens* to you.

(Pause.  One of the students actually cringes.)

STUDENT: (menacing)  Get the hell out of my face, you loser.

(Pause.  Jane looks stunned by his harsh tone.  She decides not to 
reply, and quickly turns away.  Continues to walk through the 
cafeteria, a little shaken.)

JANE: (hushed)  Wow, Jane, you're really feeling the love today.

(She's almost made it over to where she and Daria normally sit, when 
out of nowhere a student crashes into her, practically knocking her 
to the ground.  In the process he reaches over and spills something 
down her back.  Then he runs off.)

JANE: (thoroughly pissed)  *Watch* it!!  (She sinks down into her 
usual seat, removes her jacket, and examines the food stains.  Gets a 
hurt, frustrated look on her face, flings the jacket on the table.) 
Jesus, what the hell is *with* you people??!  What did I ever do to 
you??

(She slumps forward, then spies Jodie coming over.)

JANE: (sullen)  *You're* not gonna scorn me, too, are you??

JODIE: (sounding frustrated)  No way.  I've spent the entire morning 
trying to diffuse the rumors Sandi spread about you.

(Jane utters a sharp laugh.)

JANE:  Geez, these must be *some* rumors.  'Cause a few days ago, I
wasn't getting *any* of this.  (Bt)  I mean, what, did she say I'm a 
slut, or something?  A lesbian?   That I do drugs??

JODIE:  Not exactly --

JANE:  That I'm a lesbian who does drugs??  I mean *geez*, (sarcastic 
chuckle) you'd think I *killed* somebody.

(Pause.  Several students, upon hearing this last bit, stop dead in 
their tracks.  Jodie lowers her eyes.  Jane absorbs their reactions, 
gets a horrified look on her face.)

JANE:  She didn't.

JODIE:  Not those exact words, but close enough.

(Beat)

JANE:  I don't believe it.

JODIE: (shaking her head)  All I can say is that Sandi must have some 
kind of network running for these rumors to spread through the whole 
school so fast.

DARIA: (offscreen)  Oh she's got a network, all right.  (She walks 
toward them, wearing a deadpan expression.)  Come see for yourself.

(Pause.  Jane and Jodie look at each other, then make a move to 
follow Daria.  fade-out.)

(fade-in to shot of Daria sitting at one of the library computers, 
with Jane and Jodie hovering over her.  The angle is such that we 
can't see what's on the computer screen.)

DARIA: (reading)  W-w-w dot Sandi *rules* dot com.

JANE: (reading.  sarcastic)  Sandi's Secrets for a Good Hair Day. 
All *one hundred* and fifty-seven of them.

JODIE: (reading)  Sandi's Ideas for How to Make the School a Super 
Awesome Place.  (irritated)  This is just a bunch of fluff.

JANE:  Dammit -- why didn't *we* think of creating a website?  (Bt. 
to Daria)  So where's the stuff designed to crucify me?

(Daria gets a grim look on her face, then scrolls down to the bottom
of the page.  Jane and Jodie read, both of their faces growing pale.)

JANE:  Good lord.

(cut to: )
 
SCENE 6 (hallway, a short time later)

(Shot of Daria and Jane walking along, having just parted ways with 
Jodie.  Jane looks understandably pissed off, while Daria looks 
vaguely concerned.)

JANE: (muttering)  She's no dummy, I'll give her that.  She never 
actually comes out and *says* anything bad about me, but everything 
in that section points to a criminal past.  Can I sue??

DARIA:  Sure, if you find a lawyer greedy enough.  (Bt)  But my mom's 
been busy.

JANE:  I'll do *better* than sue -- I'll create my *own* website: 
"Jane Lane -- the True Story."  May the virtual pen be mightier than 
the sword.

DARIA:  Think people will believe you?

(Beat)

JANE: (downcast)  I hope so.  (Bt)  Um, by the way, thanks for showing me the
site.

(Daria shrugs.  She's about to respond, when suddenly she and Jane both catch
site of something and stop dead in their tracks.  Cut to their POV: Sandi is
with a reporter and cameraman -- they appear to be wrapping up an interview.
Resume shot of Jane and Daria.)

JANE: (frowning)  I'm almost afraid to wonder what that was about.

DARIA:  I think we'll find out soon enough.

  (cut to: )

SCENE 6 (Lane house, after school)

(Shot of the outside.  Cut to shot of Daria and Jane in Jane's room.
Daria's sitting on the bed, while Jane is venting at her easel.  Both
are watching the T.V., on which we see a news broadcast of Sandi that
was taped earlier.  Sandi is standing there, poised and smug, talking
to a puff-piece, "human interest story" reporter.)

REPORTER: (gushy)  ... And to *think*, Sandra Griffin, a Lawndale 
High student running for president of the student body, has donated 
an unprecedented three *thousand* dollars to her school to buy *new* 
textbooks.  What on *earth* made you do it, Sandra??

SANDI: (faux gracious)  Well, it was just *sitting* there in the 
account my parents started when I was a *baby*.  I decided the school 
could put it to better use than *I* could.

REPORTER:  Such selflessness!  An *unprecendented* display from a 
teenager of this modern world!  Sandra, did running for *president* 
have anything to do with your donation??

(Cut to brief shot of Daria and Jane.  They roll their eyes at the 
woman's thickness.)

SANDI:  Only in the sense that it's made me see how much I want to 
give *back* to the school that's given *so* much to me.  I *really* 
want to help my fellow students, just as I served them for *two* 
years as president of their fashion club.

(Cut to brief shot of Quinn watching with Tiffany and Stacy in the 
Morgendorffers' living room.  Tiffany and Stacy have "Oh, cool!" 
looks on their faces at the sight of Sandi.  Quinn looks resentful.)

REPORTER:  Well not to play favorites, but I'm *sure* in this age of 
the high school massacre and teen-on-teen violence, you would do an 
*excellent* job preserving the harmony of the student body.

SANDI: (suddenly sounding serious)  That's *exactly* what I intend to 
do, m'am.  'Cause there've been too many signs of possible 
*disharmony*.

REPORTER: (faux intense)  Please -- *explain* what you mean.

(Cut to brief shot of Daria and Jane.  They exchange wary looks.)

SANDI:  I mean lately *some* people have been crawling out of the 
woodwork and *claiming* to be regular students, when in fact they've, 
like, never had *anything* to do with the student body.  They've just 
been *alone*, an' *weird*, doing God knows what.

REPORTER: (faux intense whisper)  How *frightening*.

SANDI:  *I'll* say.  (ominous)  An' it really *scares* me, what they 
could be plotting.  'Cause, like, why *else* would they bother to 
show themselves -- all of a *sudden*?  (Bt)  Just when we learn to 
trust them most, they could (pause) *turn* on us.

REPORTER: (breathless)  Yes, *yes*.  Some say that's how Columbine started.

(Cut to shot of Kevin and Brittany in the Taylors' living room.  They 
pause long enough in their making out to absorb what Sandi just said.)

BRITTANY:  Eap!

(Resume shot of Sandi and the reporter.  Sandi nods emphatically.)

SANDI:  And I don't want that to happen to *our* school.  (turns to 
face the camera)  So I want to urge *all* the good students of 
Lawndale High to *be* aware.  That weird person who may seem so 
friendly --

(Cut to shot of Kevin and Brittany, watching intently.)

SANDI: (offscreen) -- an' wants your support could actually be 
waiting to *hurt* you.

(Cut to shot of Daria and Jane watching.  Daria looks irritated, 
while Jane looks about as close to enraged as she possibly could.)

SANDI: (offscreen)  You never, ever know.  I plan to discuss this 
more at a *party* I'm --

(Unable to stomach Sandi's visage any longer, Jane looks down at her 
paintbrush.  She focuses grimly on it for several seconds, then gets 
an idea.  Swirls the brush in paint.)

JANE:  Pardon me, Daria.

(She leans toward the T.V. screen.  From our angle, we can't see what 
she's painting, but her two long, emphatic strokes suggest a symbol. 
Daria looks at it, stunned.)

SANDI: (offscreen) -- this weekend...

(fade-out.  fade-in to: )

SCENE 7 (Lawndale High, next day)

(Shot of Jane setting up in the art room.  She's mixing paints and 
venting to Jodie, who's standing beside her.  It's the very beginning 
of class -- Ms. Defoe hasn't arrived yet, and students are only just 
starting to drift in.)

JANE: (grim.  angry)  Well looks like I'm on the outside again.  Only 
instead of just being ignored, I've become a social pariah.  I knew
all that respect I was getting wouldn't last.

JODIE:  Jane, it's okay -- Sandi may've gotten to a bunch of people, 
but not the whole student body.  You've still got some support.

(Jane utters a sharp laugh.)

JANE:  Maybe *some* -- but what little I've got seems to be slipping 
fast.  Not even *Quinn's* powers can ward off all the evil eyes I've 
been getting.  They're even coming from people in *this* class.

(She gestures at some of the students coming in.  Many of them are 
looking at Jane warily and keeping their distance.)

JANE: (grim)  I'll admit before the campaign, my opinion of the 
student body wasn't too high, but I didn't think they could be this 
easily bought.

(Jodie regards her with a pensive, searching expression.  Just then, 
Brittany and Kevin come in.)

KEVIN:  ... An', like, babe, Coach said the *new* football manual's 
pictures are gonna be in *color*.

BRITTANY:  Ooh, that sounds *pretty*!  Maybe the new cheerleading 
manuals will be, too!

(Jane watches them move offscreen with a deadpan expression.)

JANE:  Et tu, Brute?

(Beat)

JODIE: (sounding sort of quiet)  Jane, look, if the students really 
care about good government, they're not gonna be swayed by any bribes 
or threats.

JANE: (cold)  Yeah, well maybe they don't care.  Maybe we've just 
been fooling ourselves.

(Jodie gives her that searching look again.  We then hear one of the 
students in class speak up.)

MALE STUDENT: (to Jane.  snotty)  Don't whine just 'cause Griffin 
told us the truth about you.

JANE:  Which truth??  The *real* one or the one you've manufactured 
in that genius head of yours?

MALE STUDENT: (unfazed)  I always knew there was something freaky 
about you.  The way you dress, the stuff you paint -- all death and 
disease.  Just 'cause Griffin chose to warn us --

JANE: (disbelief)  To *warn* you??  Ooh, how noble.  (Bt)  Well then 
why didn't someone warn you about *her*?  I've seen *sewage* pipes 
cleaner than Sandi Griffin.

MALE STUDENT:  Spoken like a true freak.

JODIE: (before Jane can reply.  irritated)  Hey, *listen*.  You 
respect *me*, right?  You know how much *I've* done for the school, 
don't you??

(Pause.  The guy gets a sheepish look on his face.)

MALE STUDENT:  Well *yeah*.  Sure... I do, Jodie.

(Beat)

JODIE:  Then you should *also* know that Jane's a friend of mine. 
And I don't make friends with psychokillers.  Or criminals.  Or 
*anyone* without moral integrity.

(Pause.  The guy looks even more sheepish, nods quickly, then moves 
away.  Jane looks at Jodie, impressed.)

JANE:  Wow, Jodie.  I owe you one.

JODIE:  Don't mention it.

(Just then, Daria walks in.  Jane turns to her, peevish and relieved.)

JANE:  Well *there* you are.  Where've you been??

DARIA:  I got a little sidetracked.  (Bt)  And maybe I shouldn't tell 
you this, but your persecutor just passed by this room.

JANE:  Sandi??

(Daria nods.  Without waiting another second, even long enough to put 
her paint down, Jane leaves the art room.  Daria and Jodie exchange 
"Uh-oh" expressions.)

(cut to: )

SCENE 8 (hallway)

(Shot of Sandi just passing around a corner.  She's walking alone. 
Suddenly we see Jane coming around the corner.)

JANE:  Well if it isn't the philanthropist.

SANDI: (caught off-guard)  Oh, um... hi.

(She pauses, as if unsure whether to stay or walk on.  Glances around 
uneasily, looking for backup in case she needs it.  Unfortunately for 
her, the hallway's thinly populated, since most people have gone to 
class.  Meanwhile, Jane is standing a short distance away from her, 
stirring her paint.)

JANE:  Saw your website.  *And* your interview.

SANDI: (eyeing the paint nervously)  You're not gonna, like, *hurl* 
that stuff at me, are you?

JANE: (faux pleasant)  Oh-ho, no.  (Bt)  I think words will be messy enough.

(Sandi nods, but backs away a little nonetheless.)

JANE: (frustrated)  Well I gotta say, Sandi: I'd pegged you for a 
bitch, but I'd *really* hoped you'd never stoop so low.  You 
seriously think the presidency is worth making me look like a 
potential *murderer*??

SANDI: (very uncomfortable, and with a touch of remorse)  That's not, 
um... exactly what I --

JANE:  Well pretty *damn* close, trust me.  (Bt)  Too bad we 
couldn't've just run on the strength of our ideas.  But surprise, 
surprise -- I guess that's just not how Sandi Griffin *deals* with 
life's challenges.

(Beat.  Now Sandi looks defiant.)

SANDI:  Hey, I was just doing what any *normal* person running for 
office would do.  Just 'cause *you* weren't smart enough to think of 
it *first* --

JANE: (rolling her eyes)  Ooh-hoo, right.  *Normal*.  If that's 
normal, then I sure as hell hope to stay a *weirdo* my entire life.

SANDI: (barely audible)  Shut the hell up.

(Beat.  Jane's eyes narrow, and she gazes at Sandi probingly.  She 
senses there's something more in Sandi's tone than meets the eye, and 
decides to take the civil route.)
 
JANE:  Look, I'll let you off with a warning.  Remove the website, 
offer me a public apology, and let's run a *real* race in the few 
days we've got left, okay?

SANDI: (haughty)  Or *else*?

JANE:  Or else you get a taste of your own medicine.

(Sandi looks at Jane incredulously.  Then she tosses her hair and 
smirks faintly.)

SANDI:  Like anyone would *believe* you.  By now you've *probably* 
sunk so low, not even the *freaks* would vote for you.  (Bt)  The 
website stays.

(Beat)

JANE: (eyes narrowing)  Fine.  (Bt)  Then there's something you should know.

SANDI:  What?

JANE:  About the paint?  I lied.

(Before Sandi can react, Jane splashes it in her face.  For several 
seconds, all Sandi can do is shudder as it trails down her shoulders 
and spills onto the ground.  Then she gets an enraged expression on 
her face.  Looks as though she's about to lunge at Jane, when 
suddenly she spies a couple of students walking along.  The students 
stop walking and gawk at her.  Sandi quickly regains her cool.)

SANDI: (to the students.  triumphant)  What did I *tell* you?  Dangerous.

(fade-out.  fade-into: )

SCENE 9 (lockers, shortly after the encounter)

(Shot of Daria and Jodie leaning against them.  After Sandi left to
wash off the paint, they tracked Jane down.  We now see Jane pacing 
around in front of them with uncharacteristic rage.)

JANE:  I *can't* believe I wasted perfectly good paint on that girl!

JODIE:  Shhh, Jane, it's okay.  Daria and I --

JANE: (not hearing her) What I *should've* done was take a paintbrush 
and *cram* it up one of Sandi's perfect little nostrils, then watch 
her die a *hideous*, agonizing death.

(Jodie sighs.  Daria watches Jane with a mixture of sympathy and concern.)

JANE:  God, I hate her!  I don't understand how *anyone* can act the 
way she does.  Dammit, *she's* the one who had the advantages coming 
into this race, *not* me.

JODIE:  Jane, Daria and I made --

JANE:  Well if she *wants* to play rough, then *I'll* play rough.  I 
can smear a name as well as the next candidate -- and I don't even 
have to lie!  Sleeps around with the football players, has an 
*eensy*-weensy drug problem, got held back in seventh grade, was
charged with shop lift--

DARIA: (serious)  You sure it's worth it?

JANE:  To *clear* my name, *yeah* it's worth... (suddenly realizes 
what she's saying.  She stops pacing, blinks as if trying to see 
clearly, then finally sighs and slumps against a locker.)

(Beat)

JODIE:  Jane, I know it's hard, but for now try to forget what's 
happened and keep your eye on the goal

(Jane laughs sharply.)

JANE: (bitter)  The *goal*, eh?  Frankly I'm starting to wonder why I 
even ran for president in the first place.

(Beat)

JODIE: (a bit surprised.  a slight edge in her voice)  'Cause you 
wanted to help the students, right?

(Beat)

JANE: (looking uncomfortable)  Um... yeah.

(Pause.  Then Jodie sighs again.)

JODIE:  Look Jane, I'm sorry.  I sort of feel like this whole thing's my fault.

JANE: (incredulous)  *Your* fault?  How??

JODIE:  I encouraged you to run -- mainly 'cause I didn't have the 
guts to run on my own.  (Bt)  I was too afraid that what's happening 
to you was gonna happen to me.  Since I'm... you know.  (gestures at 
herself.)

(Pause.  Jane and Daria look at her incredulously.)

JODIE: (resigned)  I really believe that most of the students at 
Lawndale are nice, but there's always that minority that wants to 
hate you because you're not exactly like them.  During the race for 
vice-president, I had the *displeasure* of rubbing them the wrong way 
several times.

(Beat.  Jane and Daria glance at each other.)

JANE: (to Jodie)  So what happened?

JODIE: (looking uncomfortable)  I got some threats over the phone and 
some racist slurs thrown at me in the hall.  One or two people who 
looked like they wanted to... (Pause)  And that was for
*vice*-president -- I didn't even want to risk what I'd get if I ran 
for *president*.  (Bt)  But still, I don't think even what I got was 
as bad as what Sandi's done to you.

(Pause)

JANE: (sympathetic.  reflective)  Damn, too bad that had to happen. 
You would've made a good president.

JODIE: (sort of dispirited)  Maybe.

(Beat)

DARIA: (also reflective)  So some insecure idiots kept you from doing 
what you wanted 'cause they were too afraid it'd mess with their view 
of the universe.

JODIE:  Um, yeah.  (Bt.  sighs, tries to get past it)  Well look, 
there's nothing I can do about it now.  The only thing *all* of us 
can do is work hard the next few days on damage control.  (to Jane) 
Then there's the speech at the assembly -- you can address the 
students then.

(Beat.  Jane looks grateful, then resigned.)

JANE:  True.  But I think it'd take a small miracle at this point to 
get me back in the running.

DARIA:  *Or* a counter-website.

JANE: (hopeful)  You think you can set one up fast?

DARIA: (smirking)  It's already been done.

(Beat.  Jane looks at them incredulously.)

JODIE:  Daria and I came up with the idea last night.

DARIA:  And I got one of the "cute technical types" who likes Quinn 
to help me set it up this morning.

JANE: (to Daria)  So *that's* where you were before --?

DARIA:  Yep.

(Beat.  Jane shakes her head, stunned and grateful.)

JANE:  Wow.  You guys are true friends.

DARIA: (serious)  Hey, no one gets away with abusing my friend in 
public.  (Bt)  Makes it less satisfying when *I* do it.

(Jane rolls her eyes and smirks.)

DARIA:  Besides, Sandi could've been talking about *any* of us 
misanthropes when she lashed out at you.  It was time to take action.

JANE: (crafty)  And just how *did* you take action, by chance?

DARIA: (smirking)  Let's just say that while I didn't stoop to 
Sandi's level, I *did* write some stuff that one could construe as 
*unfriendly*.

JANE: (smirking)  From you, could I expect any less?

(fade-out.  fade-in to: )

SCENE 10 (Morgendorffer house, late afternoon, day before the election)

(Shot of the outside.  Cut to close-up of Daria's phone.  It starts 
ringing.  Cut to wider shot: Daria walks over from the other side of 
the room and answers it.)

DARIA: (deadpan)  Hello?

JANE: (from the receiver)  Just came from school.  I was looking at 
our website again.

DARIA: (smirking)  Two hundred and eleven hits in the past two days. 
I just checked.

(Cut to split screen diagonal, Jane on the left, Daria on the right.)

JANE: (wicked)  I couldn't resist reading your article.  "The Dangers 
of Credulity: Why You Shouldn't Trust a Source That's Been Tainted."

DARIA:  Harsh, yet civilized.

JANE:  When you put your mind to it, you can really be an effective weapon.

(Beat.  Both she and Daria think about that for a moment.  Then Jane 
gets an amused, resigned look on her face.)

JANE:  Well anyway, the real reason I called is 'cause I've been thinking.
That vanity stuff you accused me of having a while back?

DARIA:  Yeah?

JANE:  Well... I *kind* of, sort of think you might've been on to 
something.  Slightly.

DARIA: (smirking)  Oh really?

JANE:  Yeah, well... (heaves a sigh) the main reason I wanted to run 
for president was just to prove to myself that I could.  Now and 
then, I like to think that maybe I *am* the master of my own destiny. 


DARIA:  Uh-huh...
 
JANE:  And that if anytime I ever *really* wanted to, I could get 
something the popular snobs tell me it's not my *right* to have.

(Meanwhile Daria listens, reflective.)

JANE: (resigned)  But, I guess I could've done a better job 
"controlling my destiny" during the campaign.  (Bt)  And after
Sandi's smear job turned me into a raving *lunatic* a couple of days 
ago, I finally started realizing I'd better act in ways that felt 
good to *me* instead of worry so much about pleasing *other* people.

(Pause)

DARIA:  Yeah, well, don't beat yourself up about it.  You tried 
something, it didn't work out, and you learned a lesson.

JANE:  I guess that's the most positive spin I can put on this experience.

DARIA: (reflective)  Too many people are too scared to even reach the 
"trying" part .  (Pause)  It took guts to do what you did.

JANE: (surprised)  Thanks.  (Bt)  But why the sudden attitude change? 
You've been so against this election stuff.

DARIA: (admitting)  Yeah, well... I've done some thinking, too.  (Bt) 
It's like you just said: sometimes, when you don't do anything, 
you're *still* letting other people control you.  And that's a crappy 
way to live.

JANE: (faint smirk)  And neither of us wants to live that way.  Right?

DARIA: (faint smirk)  Right.

(Beat)

JANE:  Hey you know something?   I want to see how well the student 
body can think for *themselves* -- to see whether that loyalty I felt 
toward them earlier was justified.

DARIA:  Sounds good.  How?

JANE:  By giving them a chance to *prove* they know how to elect the 
right person for president.  Care to help me out?

(Pause.  Then Daria's smirk deepens.)

(fade-out.  fade-in to: )

SCENE 11 (Lawndale High, assembly, election day)

(Shot of the outside.  We hear Sandi's voice-over: )

SANDI:  ... And so, as I've tried to show through my *textbook*
donation, my donation of *make-up* mirrors to the *unfashionable* --

(Cut to shot of the inside of the auditorium.  We see Sandi standing 
onstage, at the podium, wrapping up her speech to the student body. 
Jane sits in a chair off to the side, along with Ms. Li and some 
other members of the faculty, who now and then eye her with 
suspicion.)

SANDI: -- and the big party I threw at my house in honor of *'N 
Sync*, who *would've* shown up if their flight from *Stockholm* 
hadn't been *cancelled*, that I truly am the student who knows what's 
*right* for her school.  An' that's why you should elect me, Sandi 
Griffin, *president* of the student body.  Thanks.

(She does a bow and walks over to the seat next to Jane.  Cut to shot 
of the audience.  Students are clapping respectfully, though with not 
as much enthusiasm as one might expect.  Cut to close-up of Quinn and 
the other F.C.'s: Quinn is slumped over in her seat, looking 
depressed.  Cut to close-up of Daria and Jodie.  Jodie looks nervous 
for Jane, while Daria smirks knowingly.  Resume shot of the stage. 
Jane stands up right as Sandi sits down, to avoid having to sit next 
to her.  Ms. Li has already beaten her to the podium, and is now 
prepared to assuage the audience.)

MS. LI:  *Excellent* speech, Ms. Griffin.  And *now*, um, students: 
let's give a *big*-hearted Lawndale High reception to our *second* 
candidate, Jane Lane.   Juuuust *remember*: she hasn't been formally 
charged *or* prosecuted for any of her supposed crimes.  That is all.

(There's light clapping in the audience and some scattered "boos." 
Jane calmly walks up to the podium and surveys the audience.  Pause.)

JANE:  First, I'd like to thank my *esteemed* opponent for the 
support she's given me these past few weeks.  It's nice to know that 
even though only one of us will be elected president today, we'll 
*both* be winners.

(She smirks knowingly at Sandi, who frowns a little, picking up sarcasm.)

JANE:  You can see *more* of my thoughts on the subject at my 
website.  (Bt)  But what's even better is that even though I'm a 
person who's never participated in a lot of student activities, you 
still trusted me enough to do a good job as your president.  That 
trust has meant a lot to me.

(Cut to brief shot of the audience.  No one makes a sound, but you
can feel some of their guilt.)

JANE:  And I *do* want to do a good job for you.  (Pause)  But 
unfortunately, I'll soon no longer be in a position to do so.  You 
see, I just found out that I've contracted a rare life-threatening 
disease native to the shores of Bolivia.  I'll be flying down to 
South America to start my treatment of painful injections tomorrow.

(Cut to close-up of Sandi.  Her face registers vague shock.  Cut to 
shot of the audience.  Jodie's wearing a "What the *hell*??" 
expression, while Daria continues to smirk.  Resume shot of Jane.)

JANE:  I've opted for Jodie Landon to run in my place.  (Bt)  You 
know Jodie: currently vice-president, in charge of many school 
activities, generally well-liked and respected.  You'll find that on 
all the ballots, my name's been crossed out, and hers written in its 
place.

(Cut to brief shot of the audience.  Now Jodie looks even more 
stunned, while Daria looks unsurprised.  We can also see Quinn, who's 
gone from being horrified at Jane's intention to drop out to subtly 
relieved.)

JANE:  And so with that, I'll end my little address with an *adios*. 
You can only have one president -- may you choose wisely.

(She brushes her hands together, satisfied.  Walks over and slides 
into the seat next to Sandi, who is slowly comprehending the new 
state of events.  Ms. Li and the other faculty members also appear to 
be realizing the significance of Jane's speech.)

MS. LI: (hushed)  *Jodie* Landon??  (Pause)  Yeeeeeeeees!!!

(fade-out.  fade-in to: )

SCENE 12 (after the assembly)

(Shot of the auditorium.  It's now pretty empty -- most of the 
students have gone to cast their votes.  We see Jane and Daria 
sitting idly on the edge of the stage.  From offscreen, Jodie walks 
up to them, wearing an amused, perplexed expression.)

JODIE: (to Jane)  So why'd you do it?

JANE:  'Cause you're the one who's *really* known all along about 
what the students need.  I figured dropping out would allow you to
run without having to go through the nasty campaign.  (Bt)  You're 
the right person for the job, Jodie.

(Pause)

JODIE: (quiet.  grateful)  Thanks.  (Bt)  So did both of you --?

(Jane and Daria nod.)

DARIA:  Three hours of ballot changing.

JANE: (smirking)  And we both came up with that Bolivia story -- 
off-the-wall just felt like the way to go.  (to Daria)  We work well 
together, amiga.

DARIA:  Yeah.  (Bt)  Maybe next time...

(Beat.  Jodie still looks a little stunned by her good fortune. 
Cocks an eyebrow at Jane.)

JODIE:  But what happens tomorrow, when the kids see you haven't 
caught the first flight out of Lawndale?

JANE: (non-chalant)  Hmm, haven't worked that out, yet.

JODIE:  But after all that concern with people treating you badly, 
aren't you afraid...?

JANE: (putting a hand up)  Nah, I'm not afraid of anything anymore. 
Jane Lane is *through* with wanting to prove herself to anyone, and 
is ready to return to the outcast fold.  (Bt.  to Daria)  If you'll 
have me.

DARIA: (deadpan)  We'll reconsider your membership.

(Beat.  Jodie looks knowingly at Jane and Daria.)

JODIE: (to Jane)  Well, if you say so.  (Pause)  So, you guys really 
think I have a shot at being elected?

JANE:  Puh-leeese, they'd be nuts not to have you.

DARIA:  But just in case, we'd better go cast our votes -- before the 
next Lowdown reads: "President Griffin Wins By Two."

(Jane nods.  She and Daria hop off stage, and walk with Jodie toward the exit.)

(fade-out.  fade-in to: )

SCENE 13 (Griffin residence, that evening)

(Shot of the outside.  Cut to close-up shot of the latest issue of 
the school paper [yes, the Lowdown works fast!].  The front page 
headline reads: "Landon Wins Handily."  Slowly Sandi lays down the 
paper, the look on her face sullen and dispirited.)

SANDI: (flat)  I *would've* won the election if Jodie Landon hadn't 
run against me.  *Nobody* could've beaten her.

(Cut to wide shot.  Sandi's slumped forward on the living room sofa, 
while Linda stands over her, arms folded, wearing an expression that 
approaches sympathy.  Sandi eyes her with vague resentment.)

SANDI:  *Stupid* paper said some people thought my campaign was too 
*mean*-spirited.

(Beat)

LINDA:  Well what do *they* know, anyway?  (Bt)  So what's your
*next* move going to be??

SANDI:  How should *I* know??  (Pause)  Maybe I'll just sit here 
'till I, like, *croak* or something.

(Beat.  Linda shakes her head.)

LINDA:  *Now* do you see why I tried to help you out??  Look at 
yourself.  (gestures at Sandi's slouched-over pose.)

(Sandi first glares at her, then gets a dispirited, contrite 
expression on her face.)

LINDA: (briskly)  Well I'll say *this*: there's *one* way you can 
come out of this with your head held *high*.  All you have to do is 
follow my lead.

(Pause.  Sandi looks at her mother warily, then nods with extreme reluctance.)

(fade-out.  fade-in to: )

SCENE 14 (Lawndale High, the next day)

(Shot of the outside.  Cut to shot of Jodie standing with Daria and 
Jane at their lockers.)

DARIA: (to Jodie)  Well now that we've helped you get elected, make 
us proud.  Don't get sucked into the cycle of corruption.

JODIE: (cocking a brow)  Don't worry -- I can handle Ms. Li and her cohorts.
 
(Beat)

DARIA: (smirking)  For some strange reason, I believe you.

(Beat)

JANE: (to Jodie)  Well Madam *Prez*, how'll you exercise your *first* 
official act of power?

JODIE:  We-ell... before I get started on putting toilet paper in the 
bathrooms and fixing the drinking fountains, I thought (looks 
pointedly at Jane) I'd suggest to Ms. Li that we repaint some of the 
shabbier buildings.  With murals.

(Beat)

JANE: (getting her meaning)  Hmm, I don't know, Jodie.  I told you my 
people person days are behind me.

JODIE: (good-natured)  Aw come on.  You said you wanted to do a good 
job for the students.  And no one's better at art than you are.

DARIA: (sardonic)  Which esteemed scholar  coined *that* expression?

JANE: (to Jodie)  *Damn*, you're smooth.  I'll give it some thought, 
okay?  No promises.

(Jodie smiles and nods.  Suddenly, from offscreen: )

QUINN:  Oh no, oh *no*!

(She comes up to them, looking absolutely crushed.  Jane, Daria, and 
Jodie look at her, bewildered.)

JANE: (to Quinn)  *Now* what's the matter?

DARIA: (deadpan)  More good fortune than you can handle?

JANE:  Yeah -- *Jodie's* president.  Your ass is saved.

QUINN:  Oh no it's not!  Guess who just got made *vice*-president??

(No response.  Then Jane, Daria, and Jodie get stunned looks on their faces.)

DARIA:  Not --

QUINN:  Sandi!!

(Beat)

JODIE: (peevish)  But the vice-presidency's supposed to be an 
*elected* position.

JANE: (with amusement and disbelief)  Ooh-hoo -- not anymore.  I 
can't *wait* to hear how *this* came about.

DARIA:  Democracy was fun while it lasted.

(Cut to shot of Sandi and Linda walking down another hall, having 
just come from the principal's office to finish up business.)

LINDA:  You'll thank me some day.  A vice-president has *almost* as 
much authority as a president, and a *lot* more free time.  Some 
might say it's the better of the two offices.

(Pause.  Sandi doesn't respond.  She's slouching in much the same way 
as she was the day before, walking slowly.  Her expression is one of 
numbness and some mortification.  She tries to not hear what her 
mother's saying.)

LINDA:  And if you put your *mind* to it, you can really *use* that 
position to rule over your fellow students.  It shouldn't be *too* 
hard for a popular girl like you.

[This song was originally going to go into Act Three, as Sandi's 
answer to Jane's election song, but I ended up scrapping that scene 
and replacing it with the more-effective website one.  But I couldn't 
get rid of the song!]

COMMENTARY

People have been pretty understanding about having to wait an 
extra-long time for this fanfic.  In fact, their attitude seems to 
be: "What wait??"  Well that's good, because I'd been feeling guilty.

A combination of circumstances prevented me from finishing this fic 
sooner.  One biggy was, of course, the start of my fall semester -- 
having to resettle into my place in Berkeley, adjust to having 
classes, et cetera.  Secondly, I had to plot my second story arc; I 
had several ideas for plotlines to follow "Outvoted," but  I had not 
yet settled them into an overarching framework.

Thirdly, this fic just proved to be incredibly difficult to write.  I 
gave starring roles to two characters whom we're not used to seeing 
in the spotlight.  Writing Jane's lines was surprisingly difficult, 
for reasons which I'll discuss in my essay, "The Unflappable Jane 
Lane."  And my stress was enhanced by the fact that I'd stuck Jane 
and Sandi in a "fish-out-of-water" situation; thus, not only did I 
have to figure out how they would respond to a given situation, but 
how they'd respond to ones which they weren't accustomed to.  And a 
school election is one doozy of a fish-out-of-water situation: you 
have to showcase the entire school, as well as make the race between 
Jane and Sandi believable.  Plus, it struck me about halfway through 
my first draft that a rivalry between Jane and Sandi isn't funny -- 
not like, say, a rivalry between *Quinn* and Sandi would be.  They 
just aren't natural rivals; Jane is too easy-going, and Sandi would 
never feel threatened by Jane -- unless, of course, her mother egged
her on.  So I had to adjust my expectations, which resulted in me 
altering or enhancing several scenes, mostly to play up the "smear" 
Sandi does on Jane.

I had originally thought of making this an "outcasts" versus the 
"popular people" election, but that soon struck me as unworkable. 
First of all, Jane is *nominated* by popular people -- Kevin and 
Brittany.  Secondly, even though Sandi is popular, she doesn't 
represent a uniform, elitist group: she's down-and-out as the 
ex-Fashion Club president; Quinn and she are practically at each 
other's throats; and she never interacts with K and B.  Plus, aside 
from Jane and Daria, and possibly Andrea, we have no real evidence of 
a huge outcast population at Lawndale.  Thus, I ended up turning this 
into a race between *an* outcast and *a* popular person.

You were probably wishing you could have seen more of Daria.  Well, 
I'll confess that I pushed her *and* Quinn into the background on 
purpose, so I could let Jane have an episode to herself.  Contrary to 
what some may believe, I really do think Daria would be as inactive 
as she was in this fic, especially since *she* wasn't the one running 
for president.  She certainly wasn't too supportive of Jane in "See 
Jane Run" (to which "Outvoted" could be seen as a follow-up of 
sorts), and Jane had to do some heavy pursuading to convince her to
help out in "Arts 'N Crass."  In fact, upon my latest reading of Act
Two, the thought that ran through my mind was, "God, what a brat."  I
fear I may have laid on Daria's negativity a little thick, but then again,
she *was* relentlessly negative throughout "See Jane Run" and most of
"Jane's Addition."  And sometimes I've thought Jane's tolerance of her
attitude to be almost saintly.

I express more thoughts on Jane running for president in Points of Interest...

This fic represents the first where I've made major, major revisions.
Normally, I write a rough draft longhand, make some modifications,
and put the final draft on the computer, all in the space of two
weeks.  This time, I ended up changing nearly all of the scenes in
Act Three and making several alterations to Acts One and Two.  There
were times when I was convinced that I'd never finish this one, but
luckily I persevered. :-)  I must confess that even though I'm
satisfied with the results, I'm *less* satisfied with this fic than I
have been with my previous ones.  I just kept feeling like there was
something more I should have done.  Like the cheerleading scenario in
"Cheered Down," an election scenario provides infinite possibilities,
not all of which I could touch upon.  Yet at the same time, I felt
like I'd done too *much*, like this fic was too convoluted.  Y'all
will have to let me know what you think...

Moreover, the outcome of this fic was probably pretty predictable --
but bring me an election fic that isn't!  Well, maybe "Triumph of the
Retart."  I *had* at one time flirted with the idea of making Jane
president, but then I thought: "Nah.  That would be stretching the
bounds of plausibility *too* far"...

Now on to *Points of Interest*...

The Competitive Chic Fic Trilogy: I hadn't planned for "Andrea
Speaks!", "Cheered Down," and "Outvoted" to be a trilogy, but it
struck me that they naturally formed one by themselves.  The ball
gets rolling in "Andrea Speaks!", when order in the Fashion Club is
disrupted by Quinn challenging Sandi for the presidency, then getting
kicked out.  The competition continues through "Cheered Down," when
Brittany tries to get even with Quinn for getting elected *head
cheerleader*, and Quinn gets even with Sandi by finally becoming F.C.
president.  Finally, in "Outvoted," Jane gets dragged into this mess
by running against Sandi for *another* high office.  Each fic has a
twist at the end -- in this one, the twist was, obviously, that Jane
arranged for Jodie to run in her place.  And after "Outvoted," the
dust finally clears: Sandi will be vice-president of the student body
for a while, and Quinn will remain F.C. president.

A couple more reasons why "Outvoted" felt less satisfying to write
was 1) that I kept comparing it to the much-funnier "Cheered Down,"
and 2) between the trilogy and "None in the Family," I was getting
*really* tired of writing fics where the characters were at each
other's throats.  Look for my next fanfic to be fairly toned-down.
Everyone could use a rest. :-)

Jane:  We all know that she, like Daria, is pretty cynical, so
perhaps it could be considered out of character for her to decide to
run for president.  But then again, as she herself says in Act One,
sometimes when an opportunity like that "falls into your lap," you
change your attitude.  You could see the same sort of philosophy at
work in "See Jane Run": Jane probably never would have gone out for
track if 1) Ms. Morris hadn't rubbed her the wrong way, and 2) she
weren't attracted to Evan.  Moreover, Jane strikes me as a cautious
optimist, someone who's naturally more open-minded than Daria -- and
someone who might believe that she could alleviate the problems at
her school if given the chance.

In addition, contrary to popular belief, I don't think Jane is the
kind of person who's always "above it all": she's got *some*
sensitivity to how others perceive her, as seen in "See Jane Run."  I
wish the show would explore her vulnerabilities a little more, but
for now, I had to make do with what's available.  I figured
underneath Jane's unflappable faade lurks *some* desire to be
accepted, and some tendency to be "swayed" by others.  With regard to
the latter: we see that Jane gets swayed into accepting a "by" on her
math test in SJR, as well as into entering the poster contest (thanks
to the encouraging words of Ms. Defoe) in A'NC.  Therefore, I could
see Jane being willing to follow Jodie's advice, even if it meant
doing things she wasn't used to doing (like spouting soundbites).

But I'll be really, REALLY interested to know if people feel I kept
her in character or not...

Sandi: Okay, I set out to make her seem more human, less the "bitch,"
in this fic, but I fear I may have done the opposite. :-)  I did
strive to make her motives understandable, and even to suggest that
she *could* be a nicer character if given the chance.  It was easier
to work with her than to work with Jane because we've seen her so
much less -- therefore I could speculate more.  The problems she has
with Linda will show up again in future fics.  Also expect to see her
clash with Jodie on one or more occasion...


Regarding the replacement for the games.  I've come up with a segment
called **THE MYSTERIES OF.**  Basically, it looks at aspects of my
fic writing and answers questions you may have been silently asking.
Like, why does she spell Eap E-A-P, when any other sane person on
earth spells it E-E-P??  This, and more, will be addressed in the
postscript of my next fic.

Now *Oops*... and there's a big one this time...

C.E. Forman told me that he wasn't the one who came up with the name
"Evelyn" for Grandma Barksdale.  I could have *sworn* I'd read it
somewhere (I did *not* make it up!), but I can't remember where.
"Alienation Legacy" was the only fic I recalled reading which looked
at the Barksdale family, so I assumed it came from there.  Will the
*real* name-giver please stand up??


****And NOW, the moment you've all been waiting for... the NAME of my
continuum!!!***

It struck me that other people's continuums have names: mine should,
too.  At first I was going to call it Kara Wild's Parallel Universe,
but that seemed kind of boring.  I thought, "You have a fun last name
-- play with it."  So then I thought of The Wild and Crazy Universe,
but I worried that that would give the wrong impression about my
fanfics (i.e: that they were super off-the-wall).  So finally, I went
with:


			***THE DRIVEN WILD UNIVERSE***


I chose that one because ever since C.E. Forman gave me the nickname
in his review of "'Shipped Out" (which bears a slight resemblance to
his fic, "Driven Wild"), I couldn't get it out of my head.  So I
thought, "What the hell?  Why not use it?"  Thanks, C.E... :-)

Note to all you 'shippers: I'm perfectly aware of the irony of me, a
certified anti-'shipper, choosing the name of a 'shipper story to
overspread my fanfic collection, so please don't make any jokes... :-)

Some characteristics of The Driven Wild Universe:

** Each fic is a *BBC* half-hour, rather than an *MTV* half-hour.
Meaning *thirty* minutes' worth of script, as opposed to twenty-one.
(Yeah, yeah, I know it's just an excuse for my fics being so long.)

** The characters remain in-character -- the same age, personality,
etc. -- but their situations differ from the ones we find them in on
"Daria."

** My fics have a high-level of continuity, as opposed to the mostly
stand-alone nature of the "Daria" episodes.

** And I still might write a "full" season of fanfics (i.e:
twenty-two).  I haven't decided.
