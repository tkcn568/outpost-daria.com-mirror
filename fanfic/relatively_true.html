<P></P>"You're Standing On My Neck" begins to play, but the title sequence will 
be as follows: 
<P></P>It is night. Camera sweeps over a rooftop. Stop on Mara, who nods her 
head and says: "All right. If we're gonna do it." She turns her head to the 
right and continues: "Let's do the bloody thing right." Music begins now.
<P></P>Mack and Damien are in Shakespearian costumes. Mack has his head shaved. 
He looks absolutely <B>PISSED.</B> He grabs Damien and pushes him into a 
rectangular pool of water at the front of the stage.
<P></P>Daria and Darren are standing in what looks like a fast food kitchen. 
They are wearing rather embarrassing uniforms that have the American Flag design 
on them. There is an older man standing between them. He grabs his head and 
falls over backward. Daria and Darren look at him, look at each other, and 
shrug.
<P></P>We see O'Neill standing, in the auditorium, next to a middle aged woman. 
Suddenly, Damien runs into the shot and tackles her.
<P></P>Darkness. Then some stage lights turn on. Mystik Spiral is standing on a 
very large stage, instruments ready. Trent has his back turned to the camera. 
The rest of the band looks scared $#!7less. Trent turns around and gets the same 
expression on his face. The camera pans to behind him. Showing Mystik spiral 
standing in front of a VERY large crowd.
<P></P>Mara is sitting in a conference room. She looks bored as all hell. She 
then pulls out a book called: <U>Vaseline, gasoline, and five hundred other ways 
to make plastic explosives.</U>
<P></P>Miranda is standing on stage at a school dance of some kind. She is 
playing a guitar. In the background, Darren is playing bass, Damien is playing 
drums, and a slightly older version of the brothers Kinsington is on the other 
guitar. Darren is wearing a dress shirt, unbuttoned, a white t-shirt underneath, 
black slacks, and black Doc Martins. Damien is shirtless. Miranda is wearing a 
white pixie dress and her hair is done in a set of tight braids, each braid 
colour alternating red and purple. She is playing what looks like a very 
complicated solo. Trent is staring at her in awe.
<P></P>Daria and Jane are in the theatre. Daria is wearing a black t-shirt and 
jeans. Jane is dressed as she usually is. Upchuck is accosting the girls. 
Miranda grabs him and pulls him off camera. Daria and Jane look in their 
direction, then exchange looks of nausea.
<P></P>Our heroes are standing in front of a bulletin board reading a notice. 
Camera moves down the line. Daria looks impassive, Jane looks shocked, Damien 
has a scowl, Darren looks angry, Miranda looks absolutely <B>pissed.</B> She is 
breathing heavily, gnashing her teeth, and her left eye is twitching. She closes 
her eyes and screams something.
<P></P>Jodie is standing in front of Mr DeMartino's class, giving a 
presentation. She puts her left hand to her forehead and continues. She puts her 
hand to her forehead again. A couple beats later, she collapses.
<P></P>The cast is in what looks like a big city. Jane is struggling against 
Daria, Darren, and Miranda, who are trying to hold her back. Jane breaks free 
and runs up the steps into a large building. Darren and Miranda look at each 
other
<P></P>Stacy is running down the halls of Lawndale High. Sandi is running after 
her wielding a blood stained Chainsaw.
<P></P>Close up on Daria, who smirks as the Daria Logo comes up over a yellow 
background.
<P></P>
<P>Daria in: </P>
<HR>
Continued from when we last left off. (And no, I won't recap for you)
<P></P><B>Fade In:</B>
<P></P>We see Stacy standing where we last left her. She is hyperventilating
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> You OK?
<P></P>Although still in shock, Stacy nods
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> So, will you do it?
<P></P><B>Stacy:</B> I don't know. Can I ask Sandi first?
<P></P>Darren winces. He knows what Sandi would say
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Why? What does <I>she</I> have to do with this
<P></P><B>Stacy:</B> Well, she's, like, my best friend. And I know that she 
<I>really</I> wanted the part, and...
<P></P>Darren gets a look of pity
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Does she have <I>that</I> big a hold over you?
<P></P><B>Stacy:</B> (confused) Um...what does hairspray have to do with this?
<P></P>Darren winces again
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Don't worry about Sandi, We'll deal with her
<P></P><B>Stacy:</B> Um...okay. But I'm still gonna ask...
<P></P>Darren closes his eyes and sighs. He knows that this conversation is 
going nowhere
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> Erm...Hey Darren, You mind if I try to talk to her?
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> (deadpans) Be my guest
<P></P><BR><BR><B>Scene:</B> Girls Bathroom
<P></P>Miranda and Stacy enter.
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> Now, I know how you consider Sandi to be your best 
friend...
<P></P><B>Stacy:</B> Yeah! I mean, she's <I>so</I> nice. Especially to Quinn, 
who came here last, and...
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> Um...Stacy? That's an act
<P></P><B>Stacy:</B> (confused) What?
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> It's an act. Sandi and Quinn hate each other
<P></P><B>Stacy:</B> (Disbelieving) No they don't
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> (sighs) Look, they may appear that way in public, but 
trust me. They'd be nowhere as civil if they were alone
<P></P>Stacy looks confused and slightly offended that Miranda would talk about 
them like that
<P></P><B>Stacy:</B> You mean she <I>lied</I> to me?!
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> Well, I wouldn't put it that way, but...
<P></P><B>Stacy:</B> (shaking her head. She's in tears) No! Sandi's not like 
that. Why would she pretend to like someone that she hates?
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> (backing off a bit) This is just how I see it.
<P></P>Stacy covers her ears and squeezes her eyes shut
<P></P><B>Stacy:</B> STOP IT! STOP IT!
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> Why do you like someone who doesn't show an ounce of 
respect to you?
<P></P>Stacy's anger starts to boil over
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> I mean, think about it. She doesn't show you any 
semblance of friendship, so why the hell do you still treat her like the queen 
of the [censored] planet
<P></P>Stacy's anger finally releases itself. She slaps Miranda, who turns her 
head to the side. She rubs her cheek and looks back at Stacy.
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> (to herself) Ok. Change of tactics (out loud) Look. I'm 
not asking you to agree to this right now. Just...This is your decision. Sandi 
should have nothing to do with this. I'll let you decide
<P></P>Miranda goes to leave. Stacy gets a thinking look to her. She then turns 
to Miranda
<P></P><B>Stacy:</B> Um... What's your name?
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> Miranda. Miranda Juliet Kinsington
<P></P><B>Stacy:</B> Can Sandi, like, not know about this
<P></P>Miranda smirks a little
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> If you don't want to tell her, she won't know until it's 
too late
<P></P>Stacy muses over this. Then, resigned, she nods her head
<P></P><B>Stacy:</B> Ok. (softer) ok. I'll do it
<P></P>Miranda smirks again and exits.
<P></P><BR><BR><B>CUT TO:</B> outside the bathroom
<P></P>Darren is sitting, indian style, against a row of lockers. He looks up at 
Miranda, as she comes out. He focuses on her cheek, which is still a bit red
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Well?
<P></P>Miranda sighs
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> Let the deprogramming begin
<P></P><BR><BR><B>Scene:</B> O'Neill's classroom.
<P></P>O'Neill is sitting at his desk, having a little talk with Kolinski
<P></P><B>Music:</B> "Big Pimpin" by Jay-Z (Just the intro. I wouldn't torture 
you by making you listen to his ramblings about what he does in his free time)
<P></P><B>O'Neill:</B> Diane, I'm rather disturbed that you made that cast 
change without consulting me.
<P></P><B>Kolinski:</B> (firmly) Well, If you had more control over your 
students, this may not have been an issue
<P></P><B>O'Neill:</B> But that poor Quinn. She must be having a <I>really</I> 
hard time with this
<P></P><BR><BR><B>CUT TO:</B> The girl's room
<P></P>The fashion club is standing in front of the mirror, preening themselves
<P></P><B>Music:</B> "Stupified" by Disturbed
<P></P><BR><B>Quinn:</B> (As her usual bubbly self) So, then they kicked me off 
that <I>stupid</I> play. Good thing. It's not like I <I>want</I> to have people 
see me in that ugly Roman dress, or whatever
<P></P><B>Sandi</B> I agree, Quinn. That play was not up to our standards
<P></P><B>Quinn:</B> Exactly!
<P></P><B>Sandi:</B> But, Since this is a public event, I would be remiss no 
other members of the Fashion Club participated. Therefore, I shall force myself 
to sign up when they redo the auditions
<P></P><B>Stacy:</B> (quietly) eep!
<P></P>They all turn to Stacy, who has her hands over her mouth. 
<P></P><B>Sandi:</B> (chiding) Stay-cee, Maybe you should do something to 
correct that Turrets syndrome, or whatever
<P></P><B>Stacy:</B> Um...sorry
<P></P>Sandi gets a look of confidence. She turns to Stacy
<P></P><B>Sandi:</B> By the way, I hope you remember that it's your turn to host 
the Fashion Club meeting tonight
<P></P>Stacy looks REALLY scared now
<P></P><B>Stacy:</B> Um...I can't
<P></P>The rest of the Fashion Club look shocked
<P></P><B>Sandi:</B> And why not? Is there something that could possibly be more 
important than your only true friends?
<P></P><B>Stacy:</B> (wincing. obviously trying to get the courage to lie to 
Sandi) No, it's just...There's this friend of the family thing. My mother's 
making me go
<P></P><B>Sandi:</B> Oh. Well, then I guess we'll have it at my house
<P></P>Stacy breathes a sigh of relief
<P></P><BR><BR><B>CUT BACK TO:</B> O'Neill's room
<P></P><B>O'Neill:</B> You know, Diane, When I was in high school, I was pretty 
headstrong myself.
<P></P>Kolinski rolls her eyes
<P></P><B>O'Neill:</B> (continuing) But, In time, I learned that you need others 
to help you do the job, after all "Many hands...make for light work"
<P></P>Kolinkski rolls her eyes, then checks her watch
<P></P><B>Kolinski:</B> Speaking of others, I want to get to rehearsal early.
<P></P>O'Neill looks at the clock
<P></P><B>O'Neill:</B> Oh, dear! Is it almost time already?
<P></P><BR><BR><B>Scene:</B> The Theatre
<P></P>Darren is making an inventory of the tool cabinet. Damien, and Daria are 
on stage
<P></P><B>Music:</B> "I'm With Stupid" by Static X
<P></P><B>Damien:</B> (Snaching a white handkerchief) Why? What's that to you?
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> (completely deadpan) If it be not for some purpose of 
import, <BR>Give't me again: poor lady, she'll run mad <BR>When she shall lack 
it
<P></P><B>O'Neill:</B> Um...
<P></P><B>Damien:</B> Be not acknowledged.
<P></P>Damien looks over to Miranda, who's telling him to stop. Damien 
acknowledges her
<P></P><B>O'Neill:</B> Um...Good, Daria, But next time, lets be a little 
bit...emotional
<P></P>Stacy walks on camera next to Kolinski
<P></P><B>Kolinski:</B> Aah, you made it. cool (To The people on the stage) Ok, 
guys? Let's pick this up later. I want Stacy here to get in some rehearsal time
<P></P>Kolinski leaves, Camera pans right to show Stacy and Upchuck standing 
next to each other. Stacy winces in disgust. Upchuck is his normal (if you can 
call it that) self
<P></P><B>Upchuck:</B> Mmm, Someone <I>has</I> been reading my dreams.
<P></P>Stacy continues to wince. Darren comes up behind them
<P></P><B>Upchuck:</B> Oh, don't worry. I'm sure there'll be plenty of times for 
you to warm up to me backstage. Let me...
<P></P>He is interrupted by a high pitched humming sound. Upchuck gets a scared 
shitless look to him as he yelps at the sound and runs offcamera We see Darren 
was standing behind him, holding a Makita (screwgun) at about the level of 
Upchuck's head.
<P></P><B>Girl:</B> (offcamera) Ugh! Get off me, you pervert!
<P></P>Upchuck growls. Darren looks at Upchuck, who yelps again
<P></P><B>Stacy:</B> Uh...thanks?
<P></P>Darren just shrugs. Camera cuts to Damien, who's sitting with Miranda on 
the edge of the stage. They are both going over translations of the play into 
ASL
<P></P><B>Damien:</B> (talking about Darren) Hmm, little love interest going on? 
(grins)
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> Not bloody likely. (beat) Hey, you know our brother
<P></P>Damien smirks and takes a drink from his water bottle. Miranda points to 
it. Damien passes it to her, where she takes a drink and sets it between them. 
Camera cuts to Daria as Mack comes up next to her
<P></P><B>Mack:</B> Hey, have you seen Damien around?
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> (completely deadpan)Yeah, he's over there, sharing fluids 
with his sister
<P></P>Mack chuckles and exits. Camera stays on Kevin, who was standing behind 
them. He looks absolutely <I>shocked</I>
<P></P><BR><BR><B>Scene:</B> Lawndale High hallway
<P></P>Mack is standing at his locker, getting his books. A rather eccentric 
Kevin is standing beside him
<P></P><B>Music:</B> "Jackass" by Green Day
<P></P><BR><B>Kevin:</B> But, Mack Daddy!
<P></P><B>Mack:</B> (Annoyed) Kevin, I'm sure you just misunderstood Daria's 
comment
<P></P><B>Kevin:</B> No way, dude! She said they were "sharing fluids!" 
(disgusted look) I mean, that's pretty twisted. I <I>know</I> what she meant by 
that. I'm not that stupid when it comes to stuff like this
<P></P><B>Mack:</B> As opposed to most of the time?
<P></P><B>Kevin:</B> (Not getting it) Uh...yeah!
<P></P>Mack tries not to laugh as he exits
<P></P><B>Mack:</B> See ya
<P></P>Camera follows Mack as the three J's run up to him
<P></P><B>Joey:</B> Hey, did you hear about the Kinsingtons?
<P></P>Mack groans and puts his face in his hands
<P></P><B>Jeffy:</B> Yeah, we heard it from Kevin.
<P></P>Mack rolls his eyes and walks off camera
<P></P><B>Joey:</B> Hey, where ya goin?
<P></P><B>Mack:</B> (offcamera) To go warn someone
<P></P><BR><BR><B>Scene:</B> School Hallway
<P></P>Damien, Darren, Daria and Miranda are standing against a brick wall, 
looking angry. Mack walks up
<P></P><B>Music:</B> <B>Mack:</B> Uh...I just thought you might want to...
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> (coldly) We know
<P></P><B>Mack:</B> But do you know who did it?
<P></P><B>Damien:</B> We gathered
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> (to Daria) You <I>do</I> realise that we're holding you 
personally responsible for this
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> (Mildly offended) Hey! What did I do?
<P></P><B>Damien:</B> Made that remark within earshot of Kevin (Turns back to 
the group) Options?
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> A good maiming? (beat) Hell, we thought about it last time
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> Nah, he's the star quarterback. I think Ms. Li'll notice
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> Thought about what?
<P></P>Miranda sighs
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> It's a long story...
<P></P><BR><BR><B>Flashback:</B> Four years ago
<P></P>We see two sixteen year old girls. One (Miranda) has long brown hair 
(like, down to the small of her back long) tied back into a ponytail. She is 
wearing baggy carpenter jeans and a baggy blue t-shirt. The other girl (her 
identical twin, Michelle) has shorter, shoulder length brown hair, round 
glasses, and is wearing black slacks and a rather tight, olive drab t-shirt. 
They are both sitting at a table in the Kenesha high school cafeteria.
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> (In a slightly thicker accent than she has now)...So 
then, 'e says about Damien: "Well, 'e's British, so he <I>must</I> know what 
he's talking about"
<P></P>Michelle laughs
<P></P><B>Michelle:</B> (in a slightly higher voice) Sounds perfectly logical. 
(looks at her watch) Ooh, I gotta go. (points to her food) You wanna finish this 
up?
<P></P>Miranda shrugs. Michelle smiles and leaves. A couple seconds later, a 
rather *cute* guy (As Quinn would put it) Walks past Miranda's table
<P></P><B>Guy:</B> (slightly nervous) Uh...hey Miranda. Uh...that's a lot of 
food there
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> (dryly, without looking up) Oh, yeah. I'm eating for two 
today
<P></P>Miranda pauses for a second, then face faults. She looks in the guy's 
direction.
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> Wait! I...
<P></P>too late
<P></P><B>Guy:</B> (offscreen) Hey Everyone! Guess what!
<P></P>Miranda face faults again
<P></P><BR><BR><B>Back to the present...</B>
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> (muttering) Stupid little...
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> So, our school isn't the only one with people like Kevin
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Sorry to break it to ya. (back to the group) Well, what do 
we do?
<P></P><B>Damien:</B> Maiming?
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Logical convincing?
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> .357 magnum to the temples?
<P></P><B>Damien:</B> (smirking) Now <I>there's</I> an idea
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Well, We'll have to think of something
<P></P>They see a female student walk by. The student briefly looks at them, 
then quickly averts her eyes.
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> Let me guess, something to embarass those responsible?
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> You know the family
<P></P><BR><BR><B>Montage</B>
<P></P><B>Music:</B> "Unforgiven" by Creed
<P></P>We see:
<P></P>Damien and Darren are sitting at lunch. Behind them, we see several 
football players throwing food at them and making rather rude gestures
<P></P>Daria, Jane (whoa! Never thought <I>she'd</I> make an appearance in this, 
did ya?) and Tom are sitting in Pizza King. Miranda comes up to their booth. A 
couple kids walk past, giving Miranda some dirty looks
<P></P>Daria and Miranda are walking down Lawndale high. A kid comes up to taunt 
Miranda. Cut to Miranda stuffing said kid into a garbage can
<P></P>Darren and Damien are being yelled at by a kid who is constantly pointing 
to a copy of the Bible. The two just stand there rolling their eyes
<P></P>Downtown Lawndale. Damien sees Kevin staring at at Ashley-Amber Taylor. 
Damien smirks and write something in a notebook
<P></P>The Kinsingtons pass by Ms Li's office. Ms Li gives them a rather 
disgusted look
<P></P>Damien is laying on his bed, late at night, reading <U>How To Change 
Anyone's Opinion About Anything.</U> He starts to highlight various passages
<P></P><B>End Montage</B>
<P></P>
<P></P><BR><BR><B>Scene:</B> Ms. Manson's office
<P></P>Damien and Miranda are sitting at Ms. Manson's desk, looking completely 
bored. Ms. Li is standing behind Ms. Manson
<P></P><B>Li:</B> (to Damien and Miranda) Now, as you know, there have been 
some… distasteful stories circulating around about your family. (shudders.) I 
would be remiss in my duties as an educator if I did not try to get to the 
bottom if this. So, if you will, please cooperate with Mrs. Manson. She is the 
best-qualified to deal with your (she purses her lips in disgust) unique 
situation.
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> Um, right.
<P></P><B>Li:</B> That is all! Good day!
<P></P>Ms. Li leaves
<P></P><B>Manson:</B> All right, well, I suppose that you two know why you’ve 
been sent here today.
<P></P><B>Damien:</B> (signing to Miranda) Why do I feel like I'm about to lose 
all respect for the APA?
<P></P>Miranda stifles a smirk, then nods.
<P></P><B>Manson:</B> What did he say?
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> (Talking and signing at the same time) Damien just said 
that he doesn't understand why we were brought here.
<P></P><B>Manson:</B> (wide-eyed) Well, you see, the situation that the two of 
you are in is rather… taboo in this country.
<P></P><B>Damien:</B> (signing, Miranda translating) Which situation? Being 
deaf? Or being British?
<P></P><B>Manson:</B> Er, no. Ms. Li was referring to the stories that the two 
of you have been practicing, um, incest.
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> (ironic) Wherever would you get an idea like that?
<P></P><B>Manson:</B> (misses the sarcasm) I believe that it first came to our 
attention when a student overheard another student’s comment about the two of 
you “sharing fluids.”
<P></P>Damien pulls a water bottle out of his backpack and takes a drink.
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> Thirdhand. And you got incest from that? 
<P></P>Miranda motions Damien for the water bottle. Damien hands it over. 
Miranda drinks, pointedly looking at Mrs. Manson.
<P></P><B>Manson:</B> Now, I understand that this is a sensitive subject, but we 
really are only concerned for your well-being. Behavior like this just isn’t 
normal, and it isn’t healthy.
<P></P>Damien takes the water back from Miranda and drinks, also looking 
pointedly at Manson.
<P></P><B>Damien:</B> (as before, with Miranda translating) Well, we do share 
fluids. I suppose you're worried about germs?
<P></P><B>Manson:</B> (irked) Well, yes, but I was referring to your mental 
health.
<P></P>Miranda takes the water bottle and drinks again. The water is almost gone 
by now.
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> (to Damien) I suppose she's right. We'd both probably be 
a lot happier if we each brought our own bottles of water. She hands the water 
bottle to Damien, who finishes it off. He sets the bottle down on Mrs. Manson’s 
desk with a bang. Manson jumps.
<P></P><B>Manson:</B> (confused) Water? (Mutters to herself) I don’t want to 
know. (To the Kinsingtons) Do your parents know about what's going on?
<P></P>Miranda and Damien look at each other.
<P></P><B>Damien:</B> (to Miranda, who does not translate) This would be a lot 
easier if she was just a little bit smarter.
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> Mrs. Manson, Damien and I have been sitting here sharing 
fluids right here in front of you.
<P></P>Manson leaps up from her desk to get a better look at them. After a 
moment, she sits down, sheepishly.
<P></P><B>Manson:</B> Um, what?
<P></P>Miranda picks up the water bottle and waves it in front of Mrs. Manson’s 
face.
<P></P><B>Manson:</B> Oh, I see. (Pause, as it dawns on her.) Oh!
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> It never occurred to anyone that perhaps the story got 
garbled in translation.
<P></P><B>Manson:</B> (upset) Oh my.
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> (sniffles--she’s faking, but once again Manson doesn’t 
get it) And now, with the comments and the snickering and the being ostracized… 
(sniffles again) I don’t know. I just don’t feel good about myself anymore.
<P></P><B>Manson:</B> (brightening) Well, dear, we do have a self-esteem class 
here at Lawndale High that could help you with that.
<P></P>Miranda stands.
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> Uh, I'm not a student, If I want to talk to O'Neill, I 
will?
<P></P><B>Manson:</B> (calmly) Oh. Then, what would you suggest?
<P></P><B>Damien:</B> (smiles wickedly) My family would like the opportunity to 
make a little statement at the next assembly.
<P></P><B>Manson:</B> (adamant) Well, I guess that could be arranged…
<P></P><B>Damien:</B> (also stands) See that you do.
<P></P>Damien and Miranda exit. Mrs. Manson picks up the water bottle, looking 
at it thoughtfully. Then she drops it on her desk, shuddering slightly.
<P></P><BR><BR><B>Scene:</B> LH Auditorium
<P></P>Ms Li is standing on stage, speaking. The Kinsingtons are sitting 
upstage, along with Mr. O'Neill, waiting to make a statement
<P></P><B>Music:</B> "Eva" by Orgy
<P></P><BR><B>Li:</B> And so, those responsible for that <I>disgusting</I> 
incident with the noodles have been found and punished accordingly (winces). And 
now, we have the Kinsingtons here, who'll attempt to disprove a malicious rumor 
that's been floating around (scoffs)
<P></P>They get up and walk to the front of the stage.
<P></P><B>O'Neill:</B> (nervously) Uh...thank you
<P></P><B>Damien:</B> (signing to Miranda) Here we go again
<P></P>Miranda smirks
<P></P>Darren starts speaking
<P></P><B>O'Neill:</B> Now, I'm sure you've all heard a lot of rumors going 
around about the Kinsingtons practicing (shudders) ew.
<P></P>Miranda glares at O'Neill
<P></P><B>O'Neill:</B> And I just want to say, sharing rumors ...
<P></P>Darren glares at O'Neill
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> You're not helping us
<P></P>The audience laughs
<P></P><B>O'Neill:</B> Oh...uh...what I meant to say was...
<P></P>Darren grabs the microphone away from O'Neill, who eep's.
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> (slightly angry) What <I>we</I> meant to say was that, for 
the past three days, your star quarterback had heard something and took it to 
mean that we practice incest. We're here to say that that is complete and utter 
<I>BULLSHIT</I>. 
<P></P><B>Li:</B> (offscreen) What the...?!
<P></P><B>Kevin:</B> (offscreen) Hey! Don't talk like that, I'm the QB!
<P></P><B>The Kinsingtons and Mack:</B> (in unison, angry) <I>We know</I>
<P></P><B>Kevin:</B> Oh, well...at least I'm not practicing insects!
<P></P>Miranda rolls her eyes, then takes the microphone from Darren
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> Oh, I dunno. Don't I always see you lusting after your 
girlfriend's stepmom?
<P></P><B>Brittany:</B> (offscreen) KEVVY! HOW COULD YOU (slap!)
<P></P><B>Kevin:</B> OW! But babe! The audience laughs. Damien turns to Miranda 
and signs...
<P></P><B>Damien:</B> Uh, Don't you think you're stretching that a bit?
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> Get bent
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> (smirking) While we're on the subject of Brittany, How 
many of you have seen Brit's stepmom?
<P></P>some members of the audience raise their hands
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> (in a shit eating grin) Well, have you ever noticed how 
they look, shall I say, rather suspiciously alike? Particularly since they have 
no blood relation, as far as we know
<P></P><B>Brittany:</B> What are you saying?!
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> C'mere.
<P></P>Brittany comes to the front row, Miranda jumps down from the stage and 
walks to her.
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> Just that the possibility exists that (whispers into 
Brittany's ear)
<P></P><B>Brittany:</B> (shocked) You don't know that!
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Well, you don't know about us, either. So don't start 
making up rumours about us
<P></P>The audience is silent. Finally, Kevin speaks up
<P></P><B>Kevin:</B> So, uh...does this mean you <I>don't</I> practice insects?
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> (straight faced) No, Nor do we practice <I>incest</I>. 
Last time I checked, sharing a bottle of water wasn't a perversion
<P></P><B>Kevin:</B> Oh, Well, uh...sorry, dude
<P></P>The Kinsingtons walk offstage and join Daria.
<P></P><B>Jane:</B> Nice work
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Thanks
<P></P><B>Scene:</B> Hallway outside Daria's locker
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> So, pizza?
<P></P><B>Jane:</B> Why not? Now that you all can manage to share a booth
<P></P><B>Damien:</B> (signing. Miranda translating) Don't even joke about that
<P></P><B>Jane:</B> And think of the important lesson learned
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> and what <I>is</I> that lesson?
<P></P><B>Jane:</B> (shrugs) Your guess is as good as mine
<P></P>Miranda smirks.
<P></P><B>Jane:</B> And Trent's playing tonight. (to Miranda) I'm sure he'd like 
to see you there
<P></P>Miranda blushes
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> Erm...cool
<P></P>Jane smirks
<P></P><B>Jane:</B> (to Daria, who's glaring at her) What? I like to be a yenta. 
It makes me feel like a normal sibling
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> Since when have <I>you</I> ever wanted to be normal?
<P></P><B>Jane:</B> (beat) Touché, Morgendorffer
<P></P>Daria smirks. Enter Kevin
<P></P><B>Kevin:</B> Hey, uh...So, when you said you were "sharing a water 
bottle," you didn't <I>really</I> mean "Sharing a water bottle," right? 
<P></P>Darren rolls his eyes, turns around, and bangs his head against the back 
wall of Daria's locker

<P></P>Finally. First of all, before I get to the endnotes, I would like to give 
MANY thanks to the Canadibrit and Lady B, if no other reason than just for 
encouraging me to not give the whole thing up. And to CB in particular for her 
comments during the various stages of the fic's evolution. Thanks to the both of 
ya
