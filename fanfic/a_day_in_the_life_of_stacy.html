<hr><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Stacy woke up to yet another day. Another
day of high school. Another day of surpressed thoughts. Another day of
being one of the crowd. Another day... of being popular.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Being popular was the most important thing
in Stacy&#8217;s life. Ever since she was five, her parents had stressed the
value of friends. Intelligence, a good education, and depth were all
good things, Mommy had said, but were useless if you had no one who
would listen to you and value your opinion. So you must maintain your
popularity, even if it meant sacrificing your identity.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Stacy showered and dressed in her best red
skirt, matching leggings (it was still a little cold, but spring was
just around the corner, and that meant <i>shorts!</i>) and a pink baby T.  As she was braiding her hair, she spied one of her favorite movies, <i>Heathers.  Maybe I can find some way out of study hall and go watch it in the student lounge.</i>  With the movie stuffed in her book bag, she went downstairs for breakfast.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Mommy and Daddy were already at the
breakfast table. "Sandi invited me to her sleepover tomorrow, and I
have a date tonight," Stacy started in.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"That&#8217;s wonderful, sweetie," replied Mommy, "Who is he?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Rick Ferris.  He&#8217;s a junior."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"What ever happened to Bret?" Mommy&#8217;s tone was a mixture of curiosity and accusation.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Well, I don&#8217;t know. We went on the date,
and then he just wouldn&#8217;t talk to me, anymore. When I tried to call
him, he wasn&#8217;t at home."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"And what did you do to elicit this kind of response?  You didn&#8217;t talk him to death, did you?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Well, I was just trying to make conversation," replied Stacy defensively.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Dammit, Stacy! Who knows how far that might
have gone? For all you know he could have been your future husband! Now
I&#8217;ll never have any grandchildren, and you&#8217;ll grow up to be a spinster!
Aren&#8217;t I right, John?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Daddy looked up from his newspaper. "Huh...
Oh, yeah Ellen, you&#8217;re absolutely correct," he said, looking at Stacy
with a vapid gaze.
</font></p><hr noshade="noshade"><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Hey Stacy, wait up!"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Stacy looked back and saw Ted Dewitt-Clinton
running to catch up with her and looked around. Good, no one was there.
Then she smiled at him. "Hi, Ted!"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">For a four-eyed geek, he sure could run. It
wasn&#8217;t that she didn&#8217;t like Ted; quite the opposite, he was genuinely
friendly, had a positive outlook on life, and was really smart. He
could practically write books on things that she hadn&#8217;t even heard of
yet. But if anyone caught them together, her popularity would go down
the tubes, and that couldn&#8217;t happen.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"How&#8217;s the corn?" asked Stacy.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"We just planted a new batch.  It was <i>fun.</i>  You should try it sometime."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Um... sure.  Whatever, Ted."  Oh, and he was weird, but she tried to forget that.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Carry your book bag?" he offered.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Thanks, Ted.  I&#8217;ve got some gum in my purse."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Thanks."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Well so much for Bret.  He doesn&#8217;t return my calls, and he won&#8217;t even acknowledge my existence."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Oh well, it could have been worse.  He could have been one of those <i>nice</i> guys."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Stacy laughed.  "Well it doesn&#8217;t matter because I&#8217;ve got a date tonight, and <i>he&#8217;s</i> got a corvette."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Ted frowned. "So that means you won&#8217;t be
coming to the fencing lesson?" Ted had been teaching fencing in the
Virtual Reality machine at the arcade ever since about a month after he
started at Lawndale High. That was about as close to popular as he came.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"I&#8217;m afraid so.  It&#8217;s not like I come anyway."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Well, you&#8217;re always... wait a minute, Stacy.  There&#8217;s a muddy spot in the sidewalk."  He took off his jacket.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Ted, what&#8217;re you... no don&#8217;t do that!  Your jacket will get dirty."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Ted ignored her protests and lay the jacket on the mud hole.  "The way is clear for you, m&#8217;lady," he said with a stately bow.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"I am <i>not</i> going to walk on your
jacket!" she said, and walked around it. Ted forlornly picked up his
slightly dirty jacket and threw it over his shoulder. Okay, so Ted
wasn&#8217;t Joey, Jeffy, and Jamie; but Stacy wasn&#8217;t Quinn, either. Quinn
deserved something like that, and Stacy refused to flatter herself by
thinking that she was in the same league as her best friend.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">They were getting close to the school now,
and anytime she might run into her friends. "Well, I gotta go, Ted. See
you in science. Bye!" She grabbed her book bag and left him holding a
muddy jacket and some gum.
</font></p><hr noshade="noshade"><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Out in the halls by the lockers, Stacy spied
Sandi, Quinn, and Tiffany over by the lockers. They were all crowded
over the latest issue of <i>Waif</i> like piglets to a sow. Stacy knew
better than to mention her date to them while they were looking at
their grail, their bible. For herself, Stacy preferred <i>Seventeen</i> or <i>Teen People</i>.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">She went up to the other Fashion Club members.  "Hi guys!  What&#8217;s up?" she said in her perkiest voice.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"<i>This</i> is what&#8217;s up, Stacy," Sandi
said pointing to the photo of a woman in a dress. "It&#8217;s the latest
fashion. They say that this is the look that will take us into the new
millennium or whatever. And I, for one, agree. It&#8217;s <i>so</i> revealing, yet at the same time tasteful, right Tiffany?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Yeah," said Tiffany.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"That&#8217;s what I <i>said,</i> Sandi," fumed Quinn.  Stacy inwardly groaned.  She had just walked into another Sandi/Quinn power trip.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"No, you said, &#8216;it looks so five years ago&#8217;," replied Sandi.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"But what I <i>meant</i> was that it looked retro, but in a futuristic way."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Why don&#8217;t we ask <i>Stacy</i> about it, hmm?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Another swallowed wince.  No one ever asked her opinion unless they were sure she agreed.  Which she always did, outwardly.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">She took a look at the photo.  "It looks <i>so </i>rad!"
she squealed. Rules of the Conformist number one: agree now, offer
insightful thoughts later. "Hey guess what! I got a date with Rick
Ferris!" Rules of the Conformist number two: in times of conflict,
change the subject.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Quinn gasped, "That is <i>so</i> great, Stacy.  He is <i>such</i> a great guy.  With a great car, too."  Trust Quinn to stick to the priorities.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Sandi blanched.  "Oh?  If he&#8217;s <i>such</i> a great guy, then how come you dumped him last week, Kuh-winn?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Quinn&#8217;s face turned into a shade of red so bright that it would have made a red delicious apple turn green with envy.
</font></p><hr noshade="noshade"><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">First Period for Stacy was English, and Mr.
O&#8217;Neill. Quinn sat next to her as usual, but instead of discussing the
latest fashion, Quinn evidently decided to explain herself.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"It&#8217;s not as if I dated him because I <i>wanted</i> to.  But my cousin, you know, she was dating him, only she had to study or something, and she asked me to fill in."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial"><i>Could you be a worse liar, Quinn?</i> Stacy wondered to herself.  Instead she said, "Oh, that&#8217;s alright, Quinn.  And that was just <i>so</i>
nice of you to do that for your cousin. How were you supposed to know
that you were sent there to dump him? It was pretty spineless of her."
Rules of the Conformist number three: never question people more
popular than you are.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">At the front of the class, Mr. O&#8217;Neill was
teaching the lesson, "Now when we write, we must endear ourselves to
the reader! We must put our best qualities, as a writer, onto that
piece of paper, in the form of a <i>statement.</i>  Now, can someone tell me what we are writing the about?  Ted?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">From the front row, Ted piped up. "We&#8217;re
writing about ourselves. For example, when we write an essay on the
protest of gasoline as our main fuel source for cars, we&#8217;re telling our
readers that we&#8217;re concerned about the environment and that there are
things we can do about it."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Very good, Ted!" Mr. O&#8217;Neill replied enthusiastically.  "Now, would someone care to comment on why we write?  Stacy?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial"><i>To call the reader to action,</i> was
what Stacy would have said, if Quinn wasn&#8217;t there. Instead she said
vapidly, "To get a good grade?" getting a general chuckle out of the
class.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Um...  That&#8217;s not exactly what I had in mind, Stacy.  Could someone help her out?  Melissa?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"To call the reader to action," said the bleached blonde girl.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"That&#8217;s better, Melissa."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial"><i>Damn!  I&#8217;d have been right, too!</i></font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Now class, for your assignment, I want you to write a rough draft on who you are and what you believe in."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Stacy momentarily panicked.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Do we...?" she yelped.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Mr. O&#8217;Neill sighed.  "No, Stacy.  You don&#8217;t have to recite it in front of the class."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Whew!" said Stacy.
</font></p><hr noshade="noshade"><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Next period was a real study of contrasts,
as second period was History with Mr. DeMartino. Stacy lamented the
fact that Sandi invariably sat next to her and had to chat, because it
didn&#8217;t allow her to concentrate on her favorite subject. Especially
with Mr. DeMartino teaching it. He always had a way of bringing it all
to life in his lectures.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Today&#8217;s SUBJECT is the World War II era in
Germany. Now I&#8217;m SURE that I don&#8217;t need to EXPLAIN the atrocities that
the nazi party COMMITED during this time, as you all have conscientious
PARENTS who have explained it to you anyway."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"...so, like our sponsor pulled out on us,
and we need some dough," explained Sandi. It was a good thing for Stacy
that she could keep half an ear on DeMartino and half on Sandi, and
still understand what was going on with both people.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Boy, I&#8217;ll say," Ted said to Mr. DeMartino.
"I just wonder how a group as awful as the Nazis could get into power
in the first place."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Ah, now THERE is a good QUESTION,
Theodore," said Mr. DeMartino. "Until you REMEMBER that the great
DEPRESSION was worldwide. The people of Germany would have done
ANYTHING to get out of the miserable FUNK that their economy had LEFT
for them.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"ENTER Adolf Hitler. The NEW Adolf Hitler,
who went around delivering speeches, ATTENDING meetings, shaking hands,
and kissing BABIES. As opposed to the OLD Hitler, a beer hall
revolutionary FANATIC!"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"So I was thinking, why don&#8217;t we take up a
collection from the semi-popular masses? We can start by trying to
identify with them and taking an interest in what they like."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"That&#8217;s great! You&#8217;re so smart, Sandi." By
now, Stacy had put her mouth on autopilot, and it was just putting out
random "Sandi is great" quotes.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Hitler was a master speechwriter, and he
would let loose his talents on the most DOWNTRODDEN of the German
people. In his speeches, Hitler offered encouragement, but little ELSE."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"We could let them think that they could be more popular if they helped us, and let them hang out with us and stuff."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"He began these speeches in slow, hesitant
tones; gradually raising in pitch and volume; AND THEN, HIS VOICE WOULD
EXPLODE IN A CLIMAX OF FRENZIED ANGER! But as far as substance went, he
offered vague promises while avoiding details, simple catchphrases,
over and OVER and OVER AGAIN!"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"We could start out slowly with the freshmen class, gradually work up to the whole school, and then the whole town."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"His party was deliberately inclusive,
taking in the unemployed, failed businessmen, industry, the armed
forces, and idealistic young STUDENTS such as yourselves. He claimed
that he would restore Germany to its former GLORY tear up the Treaty of
VERSAILLES, put down MARXISM, and deal harshly with the JEWS."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"We&#8217;ll talk to everybody except those loser
brain geeks. In fact, if anybody asks, our sponsor pulled out because
of them. I&#8217;ll think of the details of <i>that</i> later."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"I wished I had thought of that Sandi," said Stacy.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"So it was the disgruntled MASSES yearning
for a better GERMANY that led the Nazi Party to a majority party in
1930 Germany and subsequently, to World War II. Can anyone name one of
the foreign heroes of the ERA? Stacy?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial"><i>Hannah Senesh, Anne Franke.</i>  "Um&#8230; Norman Schwartzkopf?" was her answer.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"No, Stacy, Schwartzkopf was about FIFTY years later.  And he was AMERICAN as well,  Unless you THINK you&#8217;re in ZIMBOBWE!"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Uh&#8230;" Stacy started.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"SEE ME AFTER CLASS, STACY!" said Mr. DeMartino.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Bummer," said Sandi.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"WOULD YOU CARE TO JOIN HER, MISS GRIFFIN?" bellowed Mr. DeMartino.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"No," replied Sandi coolly.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"THEN SHUT UP AND PAY ATTENTION!"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">After class, Stacy approached Mr. DeMartino&#8217;s desk.  "Y-y-you wanted to see me, sir?" she asked meekly.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Ah yes, Stacy. I have here your score from
the last quiz on the World War II era. Would you CARE to tell me what
the grade on it is?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Stacy read the grade, "Um&#8230; ninety-three.  An A minus."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Very good, Stacy.  Here&#8217;s question number two:  What was your grade on the exam on the Great Depression?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Uh&#8230; eighty-nine, with the bonus question; a B plus."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Excellent, Stacy," said Mr. DeMartino
sarcastically. "Now let&#8217;s try three for three. What is your class
participation and ORAL grade?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Um&#8230; a twenty, an F."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Why is that, Stacy? Is it because you are
actually a SPY for the MIDDLE-EASTERN conglomerate whose hope is to ONE
DAY overthrow this government? Or is just that you hope to MAINTAIN a
so called STANDARD of popularity by PRETENDING to be a total IDIOT?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"The latter," answered Stacy quickly.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Stacy, I&#8217;m not supposed to discuss other students, but have you heard, pray tell, of JODIE LANDON and DARIA MORGENDORFFER?"	</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"I know Jodie a little."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Well, then you should know that they are
BOTH very popular and very intelligent, although DARIA would never
admit her POPULARITY, which is the smartest thing ABOUT her. In fact,
both of them are SERIOUSLY being considered for VALADICTORIAN. I wonder
what those friends you have in that so called FASHION CLUB would say if
they knew that!"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">When Stacy didn&#8217;t have a response, Mr.
DeMartino continued. "Since you no doubt are as intelligent as these
TWO young ladies, I&#8217;m going to do something I don&#8217;t usually do with the
STUDENTS that I have to BABYSIT. I&#8217;m going to give you a CHANCE to
bring up your participation GRADE with a WRITTEN ASSIGNMENT."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"What is it?" asked Stacy.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Write a two page REPORT comparing and contrasting your FASHION CLUB to the NAZI PARTY during World War II.  You&#8217;re dismissed."
</font></p><hr noshade="noshade"><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">As Stacy passed through the hall, she found
it harder and harder to surpress her thoughts. Compare her three best
friends to the Nazi Party? This was the most difficult assignment she
had ever faced. Granted they could be a little closed-minded on certain
issues, but Nazis? How could Mr. DeMartino be so mean?</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">And then there was the girl he had mentioned.  <i>Daria Morgendorffer.</i>
Stacy had never heard of her before. She wondered if she was related to
Quinn. But someone who was popular, but didn&#8217;t want to be? Stacy just
didn&#8217;t get it.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Sure, there were plenty of smart, popular
people at Lawndale High. But they weren&#8217;t as popular as Quinn and
Sandi, were they? Stacy looked over and saw Jodie with Brittany Taylor,
the most popular girl in the sophomore class. She waved to them. Jodie
waved back; Brittany gave her a dirty look. As she walked off, she
heard Jodie say, "What was that for?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"I thought I saw her looking at my Kevie last week.  Besides, she&#8217;s a <i>freshman.</i>"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"What about that <i>freshman</i> guy I saw you with yesterday?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Eep!  Uhhhhhhhhhhh&#8230;" said Brittany as her brain shut down.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial"><i>Maybe there&#8217;s more to life than being popular after all</i>.
But then, what is being popular? Brittany, Sandi, Tiffany, and Quinn
were popular; they hung out in cliques and snubbed everyone who didn&#8217;t
meet their standards. Jodie was popular; she was outgoing toward
everyone, never said anything negative about anyone (at least to her),
was dating the captain of the football team, and was involved in a slew
of extracurricular activities, including a sports team.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">And what about this&#8230; this Daria Morgendorffer that Mr. DeMartino mentioned?  What kind of popular was she?</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">It was with this in mind that she entered
Miss Barch&#8217;s Intro to Biology course. Stacy liked this course, for no
other reason than that no one in the Fashion Club could be there to
distract her, and she had a lot of pondering to do.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Ted walked in and sat down next to Stacy.  "Hi Stacy."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Hi, Ted," Stacy mumbled.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Something the matter?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"No.  I was just thinking about this assignment Mr. DeMartino gave me."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Gee, I hope he wasn&#8217;t too rough on you.  I know he can be a bit brusque."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"No, he just wanted to point my participation grade out to me, that&#8217;s all."  <i>Hmm&#8230; I wonder if&#8230; No.  But Maybe&#8230; No, he&#8217;s too unpopular&#8230; I&#8217;ll ask anyway.</i>  "Say, do you know Daria Morgendorffer?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Do I!  We once went out for pizza and to the arcade!  I <i>think</i> it was a date, but I&#8217;m not sure, because it was really my first, and I haven&#8217;t had one since then.  Why?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Um&#8230; no reason."  <i>She </i>can&#8217;t <i>be popular if she went out with Ted!</i>  <i>Or, is Ted more popular than I know?  Say something, Stacy,</i> say something!  "I heard her name being dropped a few places, and just wondered how popular she was."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Well, I&#8217;m no expert on these things, but
I&#8217;d say she&#8217;s pretty popular. She&#8217;s a bit stuck up, like those three
girls you like to hang around, but at the same time, almost all of the
popular people in the sophomore class seem to like her. In fact, she
sort of reminds me of&#8230;"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Now what are you trying to do, you <i>man</i>,"
a raspy female voice drawled like The Wicked Witch of the West from
behind them. Miss Barch had arrived. "Are you trying to pick up girls
again? This is a classroom, not a bar, you disgusting, Y-chromosome
carrying lower life form!"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Miss Barch, I just asked him a question,"
Stacy intervened. She knew that anything Ted said would just land him
in even more hot water.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Miss Barch paused uncertainly.  "Well&#8230; pipe down, now, because I&#8217;m about to start class.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Listen up class, I have here the partners
list for your science project. I&#8217;m only going to say these once: Graham
and Robert, Melissa and Brooke, Stacy and Ted," she scowled at them and
continued to rattle off the student pairs.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Together again, huh?" said Ted in his best
Han Solo voice, starting the private joke. One of the few times Ted had
come over Stacy&#8217;s house, Stacy had introduced him to popcorn and <i>The Star Wars Trilogy.</i>  Stacy had confessed a crush on Harrison Ford, and had gotten jealous in Ted&#8217;s overwhelming attention to Carrie Fisher.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Wouldn&#8217;t miss it," replied Stacy</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"How&#8217;re we doing?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Same as always."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"That bad, huh?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Stacy and Ted exchanged a quick smile as Miss Barch began to explain the assignment.
</font></p><hr noshade="noshade"><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">After class, Stacy went up to Miss Barch.  "Miss Barch&#8230;"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Oh, let me guess. You&#8217;re here to tell me that not <i>all</i> males are evil, that your little boyfriend that you talk to during <i>my</i>
class period isn&#8217;t going to take all of your money, spend all of his
time at the bar and the track, and ruin the best twenty years of your
life. And when you finally get up enough nerve to tell him to turn off
those damn Broncos and get a real job, he just walks out on you. Well,
wake up sister&#8230;"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Ted isn&#8217;t my boyfriend," Stacy cut her off.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"What? I mean, good. Okay, not good," said
Miss Barch. "Look, if you ever tell anyone I said this, I&#8217;ll deny it,
but Ted isn&#8217;t so bad, for a <i>male</i>. In fact, I might just give
him a C minus on this next project, since he almost reminds me of Mr.
O&#8217;Neill." She smiled devilishly. "The point is, better him than those
other male troglodytes you and your friends seem to like to hang around
with."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial"><i>Ted?  No way!  I&#8217;d be ruined if I was even</i> seen <i>with him, much less going out with him!</i>  "Well, I&#8217;m glad we had this little talk, Miss Barch."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Oh yes, Stacy, and I&#8217;ll certainly take what you said into consideration."
</font></p><hr noshade="noshade"><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">On her way to lunch, Stacy ran into Tiffany.  "Ready for the meeting?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Huh?  What meeting?" asked Stacy</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Sandi called an emergency meeting of the Fashion Club.  It must be important."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"What makes you say that?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Tiffany looked at her like she had lobsters crawling out of her ears.  "Isn&#8217;t it always?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Stacy suddenly realized the impact of what she had just said.  <i>Dumb, dumb, dumb!  You think too much, Stacy!</i>  "I mean... uh, what makes you think that its more important than usual?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Well, for starters, Quinn and Sandi have called a truce.  Does this make me look fat?" she gestured to her shirt.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Stacy breathed a sigh of relief. That was
too close. "No, Tiffany. You look just fine. Maybe I can borrow it
sometime?" Her tongue tripped over itself trying to get the words out.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Sure," said Tiffany, oblivious to any change in Stacy&#8217;s attitude.
</font></p><hr noshade="noshade"><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">At lunch, Sandi called the emergency meeting
to order as Stacy took out her notebook. Out of the corner of her eye
she caught Ted and some of the more geeky kids at school.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Like, as some of you already know, <i>Stacy,</i> our sponsors have pulled out.  We face a major, like, I don&#8217;t know, money crisis thingy."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Suddenly, Stacy had a flashback from Westerburg.  <i>"Is that that thing you were blabbering to me about over the phone last night, Heather?" asked Veronica Stacy.</i>  She stopped taking notes and just began doodling horses.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"So like we need some ideas as to what were going to do for cash.  Does anyone have any suggestions?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Well, I think we need a new sponsor.  Axl&#8217;s Piercing Pagoda said it needs the ads," said Quinn.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Oh yeah, <i>right,</i> Kuh-winn," said
Sandi sarcastically. "High Schoolers aren&#8217;t even old enough to get
pierced. What makes you think they&#8217;d want to sponsor <i>us?"</i></font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial"><i>Humility, Sandi? From you?</i> thought Stacy sourly.  She gazed at Ted as she absently started to doodle dresses.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"So what do you say, chess lessons for
fencing?" Ted was saying to another guy at his table. "I&#8217;ve always
wanted to learn chess, except my Mom thinks it&#8217;s too close of a
metaphor for war."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Well, you <i>can</i> look at it that way, I..." he started choking as he saw Stacy staring at the table.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial"><i>"Heather Stacy just looked </i>right <i>at me!" cried the geek.</i></font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Stacy&#8217;s head whipped back forward.  The Fashion Club hadn&#8217;t even noticed that she wasn&#8217;t listening.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"I suppose you have a <i>better</i> idea, Sandi," said Quinn.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Yeah," egged Tiffany.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"As a matter of fact, I do," replied Sandi.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Wow!" egged Tiffany.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"I was thinking..."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial"><i>To hell with it,</i> thought Stacy.  "Isn&#8217;t this a little premature?" she asked.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Silence.  All eyes were on her.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial"><i>Omigod.  What have I done?</i></font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Go on," said Sandi softly.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Stacy swallowed.  <i>These are my best friends, and I&#8217;m afraid to talk to them!</i>  "Well, I was wondering, Tiffany, how much money do we have in the treasury?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Tiffany frowned and got out some oversized accounting books.  "Uh... let&#8217;s see... carry the five... what&#8217;s two plus two?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Four," they all said at once.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Sorry.  I forgot.  It looks like we have six hundred on account, with fifty dollars petty cash."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"There, you see?" said Stacy.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"No, I don&#8217;t," replied Sandi.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Well, if we cut a few corners, Quinn <i>should</i> be able to find a new sponsor before that runs out.  Or use Sandi&#8217;s idea."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Sandi blanched.  This wasn&#8217;t what she wanted.  "Good <i>thinking,</i>
Stacy." Her emphasis on the word made her wince. As Stacy turned back
to her lunch, Sandi whispered something into Tiffany&#8217;s ear.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Yeah," Tiffany laughed.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Quinn scowled at them from across the table.
</font></p><hr noshade="noshade"><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Later, as Stacy was walking to Ms. Defoe&#8217;s
Basic Drawing class, Quinn approached her. "That was really great what
you did in the cafeteria today."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"What?  Getting under Sandi&#8217;s skin?" Stacy blurted defensively.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"No. You used your brains for the good of
the club. Sandi and I were way too busy trying to get at each others&#8217;
throats instead of trying to find an answer or even wondering if there
was a problem. I guess Daria&#8217;s right sometimes, after all."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Bell&#8217;s rang and sirens went off in Stacy&#8217;s head.  "Daria?  Daria who?" she asked.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Did I say Daria?  I meant Jodie.  Jodie Landon.  You know Jodie, right?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Yes.  Did you mean Daria Morgendorffer?" Stacy asked a little too anxiously.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Quinn stopped, turned, and looked her
straight in the eye. "I&#8217;ve never heard of any such person. Neither have
you. She doesn&#8217;t exist. Understand?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"But..."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"She.  Doesn&#8217;t.  Exist.  <i>Understand?"</i></font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Sure thing, Quinn.  Whatever you say!"
</font></p><hr noshade="noshade"><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Today class, we&#8217;re going to talk about
creating the illusion of depth in your drawings." Ms. Defoe began the
class. Stacy and Quinn sat on one side of the classroom while Sandi and
Tiffany sat on the other, taking turns whispering in each others&#8217; ear
and laughing. The Fashion Club was thoroughly divided. At least, for
the day.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial"><i>Veronica Stacy regarded Heather Sandi in
the stairwell with shock and anger. "Dammit, Heather, why can&#8217;t you
just be a friend? Why are you always such a mega-bitch?"</i></font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial"><i>"Because I can be," replied Heather smugly.</i></font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Now, can anyone give an example of the way we can create such illusions?  Quinn?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"We can draw smaller objects higher up on the paper, so that, like, it looks further away than the larger objects."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Excellent, Quinn!" Ms. Defoe said, genuinely surprised.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Careful, Tiffany, Stacy&#8217;s brainyness is catching," Sandi whispered loudly.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Stacy&#8217;s jaw dropped. No one had ever called
her a brain before. She felt a lump in her throat and her sight started
to blur. Then a warm arm was around her shoulder in the form of a brief
hug from Quinn. Stacy didn&#8217;t know whether this was out of open defiance
to Sandi or out of genuine concern for her, but it still made her feel
better. It was the first warm gesture from her best friend she had ever
had.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial"><i>Veronica Quinn sat on the floor with Heather Stacy, sleeping pills littering the bathroom.</i></font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial"><i>"If you were happy all of the time, you wouldn&#8217;t be a human being, you&#8217;d be a game show host," stated Veronica gently.</i>
</font></p><hr noshade="noshade"><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">The bell signaling the end of class rang,
and in her rush to get out of her seat, Stacy accidentally dropped her
notebook. Papers spilled out onto the floor. "Klutz!" snorted Tiffany
as she went out the door.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Quinn stooped to help pick up the papers.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"That&#8217;s okay, Quinn.  I&#8217;ve got it," protested Stacy.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Nonsense," insisted Quinn.  She picked up the papers and gasped.  "Stacy, these are <i>beautiful.</i>"  She held up a drawing of a dress.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Ms. Defoe came over and looked at the drawing.  "These are exquisite.  Stacy, are you sure that you should be in this class?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Well..." Stacy sighed. "I&#8217;m just taking
this for the credit. I&#8217;ve been drawing these dresses since seventh
grade. Fashion Design. It&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to do."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"But do you <i>want</i> to do it?" asked Ms. Defoe.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Of <i>course</i> she wants to do it.  <i>I</i> would," said Quinn.  "Don&#8217;t you, Stacy?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">This morning, if something like this had
happened, then Quinn would have just been waiting confidently for a
"Yes, Quinn" from Stacy. And Stacy would have given it to her. But
Quinn now seemed to honestly think that Stacy really wanted to do this,
and expected an honest response.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"I don&#8217;t know," said Stacy softly.
</font></p><hr noshade="noshade"><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Stacy declined Quinn&#8217;s offers to walk her to Ms. Morris&#8217; gym class.  She needed to be alone to sort out her thoughts.  Quinn <i>seemed</i> to mean well, but for all Stacy knew this could all have been done to spite Sandi.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">She spied two loser girls hanging around the
lockers. She took a good hard look at them. So this was the crowd she
would soon be joining. Still... both of them just seemed like makeover
candidates to her. Nothing in their <i>personalities</i> to turn her
off. Of course, they hadn&#8217;t said anything yet. She decided to do some
constructive eavesdropping, and positioned herself about ten feet away
from them. Then she gasped.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Two guys, about college age just walked up
to them! One was sort of cute, with short black hair and a goatee and
sort of thin; but the other was <i>so</i> hot! He had long, brown
hair, dreamy blue eyes, and no shirt at all! Just a leather vest! Stacy
would have squealed with delight if she weren&#8217;t eavesdropping. She
strained her ears to hear over the din.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Yo, Trent!" the loser with the bad makeup greeted the skinny one.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Trent wordlessly hugged the loser with the bad makeup, and then went to the one with the glasses.  The hot one did the same.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Hey, Daria," said Trent.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial"><i>No, this couldn&#8217;t be... but wait!  Popular, but didn&#8217;t want to admit it.  Maybe it is!</i></font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"What was that all about?" asked Daria.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Everyone in the band was having a bad day,
and we couldn&#8217;t take it out on the equipment because we&#8217;re broke, so we
decided to name today, &#8216;Give a hug day.&#8217; And we all hugged each other.
It made us feel a lot better. Right, Jesse?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Peachy," said Jesse.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial"><i>Omigod. </i>Jesse?<i>  His name is </i>Jesse?  Stacy&#8217;s heart began to pound as she surpressed another squeal.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Sounds great.  Maybe you should give Daria another one, Trent.  Right Jesse?" said the loser.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Peachy," Jesse repeated vapidly.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Couldn&#8217;t you have found a better word for the day?" asked the loser.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Nope."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"So, what are you guys doing here?" asked Daria.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Jesse here was hoping to get his academic
transcripts. He&#8217;s thinking about applying to this music school down in
New York. That way when he comes back, he can teach me open D tuning."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Well, aren&#8217;t you scared it might compromise your nap schedule?" asked Daria.  The other three laughed.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Good one, Daria."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Stacy&#8217;s eyes bulged. Daria had just insulted
that beefcake of a musician, and he had just laughed at it, right along
with everyone else.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"You&#8217;re sure you don&#8217;t want another hug?" egged the loser.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"You&#8217;re sure that <i>you</i> want to live to see another day?" replied Daria with feigned menace.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Why Daria Morgendorffer, I do believe you&#8217;re in love."  Trent and Jesse just stood there like stumps.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Stacy gasped.  <i>It </i>is <i>her.  She must be popular.  She&#8217;s practically got those two guys on their knees!</i></font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">The loser&#8212;Daria&#8217;s friend, Stacy
amended&#8212;turned to Daria. "Captain, we&#8217;re being watched," she said in an
impression of Mr. Spock. Then she pointed at Stacy.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Uh... um... that is uh..." Stacy took two steps back and then bolted.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial"><i>Clack!</i></font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial"><i>Omigod!  They&#8217;re throwing things at me!</i></font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Stacy ran faster.  Her breaths were coming shorter and faster now.  "Wait!"  Daria&#8217;s friend called.  Stacy ran faster.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">She turned the corner and ran straight into Ted Dewitt-Clinton.  "Ooph!" he said.  "Ow!" she said.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Are you all right, Stacy?" asked Ted.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Stacy couldn&#8217;t tell if she was just out of
breath, or hyperventilating, or both. "Girls... guys... chasing...
throwing... stuff... at me!"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Don&#8217;t worry. I have a black belt in Tae
Kwon Do," said Ted. He turned the corner. "There doesn&#8217;t seem to be
anybody there. Where&#8217;s your next class? I&#8217;ll walk you."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Thanks, Ted." For once Stacy didn&#8217;t care
who saw her with Ted, or that he was a mild mannered little geek. "So
what school did you get your belt from?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"The Dragon-Chi clan dojo over in Japan. My
parents sent me there for a year and..." he chatted merrily with her
all the way to the gym.
</font></p><hr noshade="noshade"><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Stacy still didn&#8217;t feel very well when she
arrived at the gymnasium, so she asked Miss Morris if she could walk
the track. "Oh fine, go ahead! You just don&#8217;t get points for
participation today!"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">When she got out to the track, she heard a
familiar, menacing voice. "Well look who it is, our little fashion
spy!" Daria&#8217;s friend came walking over. Stacy looked for a means of
escape. There wasn&#8217;t any. Daria&#8217;s friend reached into her shirt.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial"><i>She&#8217;s got a gun!  I&#8217;m gonna die!  I&#8217;m gonna d-</i> "You dropped this," Daria&#8217;s friend&#8217;s voice cut into her panicked thoughts.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Stacy looked what she was holding out to her.  It was her copy of <i>Heathers</i> that she had brought from home, and completely forgotten about.  She reached for it just as Daria&#8217;s friend snatched it back.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Not so fast," she said. Then she read the
back of the cover. " &#8216;Meet The Heathers, Westerburg&#8217;s most powerful
clique. Anyone would die to get into it. On the other hand, Veronica
Sawyer would kill to get out of it. But what happens when her new
boyfriend decides to do exactly that? Find out in this screamingly
funny and controversial comedy about teen angst and homicidal
tendencies.&#8217;</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Sounds like my kind of movie.  But what would a fashion fiend like <i>you</i> see in it?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"I just think it&#8217;s funny," replied Stacy, no longer quite as afraid but still ill at ease.  "So where is...?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Daria?  Officially, she&#8217;s feeling a little <i>athletic</i>
today, and is with the rest of the class. Unofficially, she&#8217;s a little
pissed at me for trying to play yenta with her and my brother again.
Why?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Stacy lowered her voice to a whisper.  "She&#8217;s <i>really</i> popular, isn&#8217;t she?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Daria&#8217;s friend snorted and started laughing.  Hard.  Stacy blushed.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"So, you&#8217;ve finally found out, huh? And I
suppose you&#8217;re going to go running to your fashion club and spread the
news. &#8216;Hey, there&#8217;s a brain in the sophomore class, and she&#8217;s really
popular!&#8217; What&#8217;ll we do? I wonder how you&#8217;d break the news to Daria."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"What?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"How would you tell Daria that she&#8217;s popular?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"I don&#8217;t get it."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Daria&#8217;s friend looked down on her and
sighed. "Look, she&#8217;s been popular for a long time. She just doesn&#8217;t
know it. I only just found out about it myself a few months ago." She
began to walk around to track. Stacy walked beside her.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"I had just come home from school and I
received a phone call from Daria. She had this rash and was in the
hospital. So I decided to come visit her.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"A few minutes after I arrived, just about
every bigwig in the school came in. Jodie Landon, Michael Jordan
MacKenzie, Brittany Taylor, Kevin Thompson, even her <i>sister</i> Quinn Morgendorffer."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Stacy&#8217;s jaw dropped again. Daria&#8217;s friend
looked her and smiled. "I bet you didn&#8217;t know that, did you? I&#8217;m not
surprised. You fashion fanatics are always the last to know about
anything. Everyone knows how popular Daria is, except Daria herself and
you."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"You don&#8217;t have to get snotty," said Stacy defensively.  Who was <i>she </i>to speak about the Fashion Club like that?</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Oh yes.  You&#8217;re probably thinking, &#8216;who am <i>I</i> to speak about the Fashion Club like that?&#8217;  Well maybe you don&#8217;t remember who I am."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Stacy squinted at her as Daria&#8217;s friend put her hair back with a rubber band.  She <i>did</i> look familiar...</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial"><i>Omigod!  No way!</i>  "Jane Lane?" she guessed.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"In the spandex," she quipped.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Omigod!  You were <i>so </i>popular! You
were just the fastest runner on the face of the earth. Of course, Sandi
always called you a jock queen, but it was like you just became popular
overnight. But then, you just, like, disappeared!"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Yeah. I was a real clique-hold word across
Lawndale," deadpanned Jane. "But I didn&#8217;t like being popular. I was
alienating my friends&#8212;the ones who had stuck by me when I <i>wasn&#8217;t</i>
Miss Teen Track, buying into a system that rewards athleticism and
beauty over intelligence and compassion, and, most of all, compromising
my beliefs. And that bothers me, because I don&#8217;t <i>have</i> any beliefs, except that I wanted to actually learn something in High School."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Well, you can still be smart and popular, right?  I mean, Jodie does it."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Yeah, but how often do you talk to Jodie?
She&#8217;s pushed to the breaking point most of the time. I don&#8217;t want to
work that hard. No, I&#8217;m happy with two friends, artwork and the
television. Of course, I guess it&#8217;s still possible. Why? Do you think
that <i>you</i> could pull it off?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Maybe.  I think I might be smart enough."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Well, if you&#8217;re ever smart enough to zip up
your backpack before a run, I think you might just do it. Mind if I
borrow this?" Jane gestured to the videocassette.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Sure."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Thanks.  I didn&#8217;t catch your name."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Stacy."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Well thanks for letting me borrow the tape, Stacy."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Stacy and Jane turned toward the school and
saw Daria walking toward them. "Volleyball sucks," she said to Jane
without a preamble. "Miss Morris said that I may as well go out here if
all I&#8217;m gonna do is lift my hand."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Payback&#8217;s an eternal bitch, baby," said Jane.  "So, Trent told me you two have a little date."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Daria muttered something unintelligible.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"What was that?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"I said, &#8216;we&#8217;re just going to see about some guitar strings.&#8217;  I see you&#8217;ve picked up an apprentice."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Oh.  Daria, this is Stacy.  Stacy, this is Daria."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"You&#8217;re not upset about some boy again, are you?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"No," replied Stacy.  <i>How did she know about that?</i>  "Well, now that you mention it, I once heard that you went out with Ted Dewitt-Clinton&#8230;"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"We did <i>not</i> go out!"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"You didn&#8217;t?  Damn.  I was wondering about taking him out," Stacy replied, much to her own surprise as Daria&#8217;s.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"He&#8217;s <i>that</i> popular?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Stacy smiled.  "I don&#8217;t know."  She shot a meaningful look at Jane.  "I&#8217;ve never been an expert on these things."
</font></p><hr noshade="noshade"><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">When Stacy got home from school, the first thing she did was call someone that she very rarely called.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Hello."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Hello, Ted?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Stacy?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Yeah.  Is there still room for me in the VR?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"I&#8217;m not teaching in the VR tonight. I was
lucky enough to get a teacher to supervise for a room at the school.
It&#8217;s novice night, you know."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Oh.  Who&#8217;s the teacher?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Miss Barch, of all people.  Maybe she isn&#8217;t as bad as the males think.  Did you want to come?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Yes.  That&#8217;s the reason I was calling.  And maybe we can get some pizza afterward?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Sure.  That sound&#8217;s awesome!  But what about your date tonight?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Oh, don&#8217;t worry about it.  I&#8217;ll get someone to fill in.  See you then.  Bye!"
</font></p><hr noshade="noshade"><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">It was getting late, but Ellen and John
never worried about curfew. It had started to snow while she and Ted
walked home. After fencing, she and Ted had gone for pizza, and then to
a movie. The movie was the weirdest experience she had ever had. All
through it she had half expected that Ted would put the moves on her
like every other guy that had taken her there. But he didn&#8217;t. Trust Ted
not to act like other guys. She sort of found it refreshing.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"I don&#8217;t know about you, Ted, but I had a really good time.  It was really very."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Me too.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever been to a movie before," said Ted.  "It&#8217;s a lot like television, huh?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Stacy giggled.  "Yeah.  A bit."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Only, if it comes out on video, why pay seven dollars to go?  Do you understand that, Stacy?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"No.  It must be because I&#8217;m dumb or something."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"I don&#8217;t think so.  You know a lot about these things.  Uh...Stacy?  Why are we holding hands?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"We are not!"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Yes we are."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Well, you&#8217;re holding my hand.  I&#8217;m not holding yours."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Ted laughed.  "Yes you are."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"It must be because my hand is cold."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"It&#8217;s actually pretty warm."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Ted, shut up!" she laughed.  "If only there were more snow on the ground."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Snowballs, right?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Exactly."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">They approached Stacy&#8217;s house.	"Well, here we are," said Ted.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Yeah.  Here we are."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"See you in school, tomorrow."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Yeah.  See you in school tomorrow."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Why are you copying everything I say word for word?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Yeah.  Why are you copying everything I say word for word?" Stacy laughed.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Ted started laughing, too.  "You&#8217;re nuts," he said.  "I gotta go.  See you later."  He started to walk back to the sidewalk.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Bye."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Bye."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Bye."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Bye."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Bye."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Bye."</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"Go home, Ted!"  Stacy laughed.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">He stopped.  "Oh.  I almost forgot to ask.  What does &#8216;really very&#8217; mean?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">"You&#8217;re going to get <i>pelted</i> tomorrow!" said Stacy.</font></p><p>
<font face="Tahoma, Arial">Ted smiled and walked away.  Stacy blew him a kiss when his back was turned.

Diary, March 5, 1999:<br><br>
Found out that the most popular girl in the Sophomore class is a brain.
She&#8217;s a weird kind of popular. She isn&#8217;t quite as friendly as Jodie
Landon, but she isn&#8217;t quite as stuck up as Sandi or Quinn. She probably
has the most exclusive clique in the whole <strike>school</strike> town.  I hope that I can be in it someday.<br><br>
Sandi and Quinn had one of their spats that escalated into a potential
civil war. I&#8217;m considering resigning as Secretary. They don&#8217;t
appreciate my opinions or my ideas, and I&#8217;m sure that there are other
clubs which would be more than happy to have me as a member. The
History club comes to mind. What Mr. DeMartino would have to say about
that! Or maybe even the Tennis Team, since Jodie is on it.<br><br>
Had my first date with Ted today. I think that I&#8217;ll take it slow with
him. He&#8217;s pretty inexperienced with this sort of thing, after all.
Anyway, I won&#8217;t tell him we&#8217;re dating until after the science project.
That way he won&#8217;t have too many things on his mind. This is sort of new
for me, too. I can&#8217;t remember ever having a steady boyfriend. All I
know is that if he doesn&#8217;t try to kiss me in the near future, I&#8217;ll
probably have to go for it. It looks like I&#8217;ll have to do a lot of
hen-pecking to get this relationship underway.<br><br>
Weather Report: Temp.35 degrees F (2 degrees C). Light snow, expected
to get heavier as the night progresses. We&#8217;ll probably have a couple of
inches. Expect a one hour delay at school tomorrow, plenty of time for
a good snowball fight!<br>
That&#8217;s all for now.  Until tomorrow!<br><br>
