Trent and Jane's party


by Jane (hello_kitty_28@yahoo.com)

Part one: The picnic 

(Daria and Jane on the phone)

DARIA: Hello?

JANE: Yo Daria...

DARIA: Hey Jane.

JANE: Do you want to come to a picnic with Jesse,
Trent and I?

DARIA: Hmmm...Okay...

JANE: We'll take you in ten minutes. Oh... we already
made the lunch, don't worry for that. Take what you
need, don't bring any
food... Okay?

DARIA: K... That's nice... thanks...

JANE: okay, bye.

DARIA: Ciao.

(Daria goes downstairs and prepares her things. Ten
minutes later, Trent stops the car in front of Daria's
house. Jane walks to the
door and rings the doorbell. Daria walks to the door
with a "big smile" (big means a little bigger than
usual.) on her face. As she
opens the door, she tries to hide her smile and
finally return to her usual expressionless face.)

DARIA: Oh, hey Jane.

JANE: Hey Daria... How are you feeling to go to a picnic
with Trent?

DARIA: Just shut up Jane...

JANE: I know you like him... don't lie...

DARIA: No... (though: LIAR!) That's not true.

JANE: (with a big smile) Oh yeah... That's what you say...

DARIA: Go to hell...

(They walk to the car and sit in it.)

TRENT: (Trent looks at Daria and smiles to her)
Hellooo Daria...How are you today?

DARIA: Hey...fine...Hi Jesse...

JESSE: Hey Daria... Jane, there's a new little
restaurant not very far, we could go there one night
(whispers) and it's a date...

JANE: (smiling to him) That's a great idea... Count me
in...

TRENT: Oh... another date. Jane, you really want to let
Daria alone one evening? Did you fall on your head?
Are you sick? (He
smiles at Jane as she glares at him)

DARIA: (Daria smile and try not to laugh) What do you
want, she likes to make torture to me... I will stay at
home with my
"Mommy, Daddy and, best of all, my little and favorite
sister, Quinn!

JANE: So sorry Daria... (And she starts laughing. At
Trent.) Why don't you ask Daria to go out with you
when we'll go???

TRENT: (looks embarrassed) I'll think about it Janey...

JANE: It would be nice from you... Oh, where are we
going for the picnic?

JESSE: We were thinking about a little park that we
know; it's not very far of here.

(Cut to the park where they are all sit on the ground
and are all eating.)

JANE: Daria, what are you doing on Friday night?

DARIA: Nothing, I guess, why?

TRENT: She was wondering if you could go to my party...

JANE: Sorry brother but it's OUR party...

TRENT: Oh yeah, sorry Janey... So will you come Daria...?
Please... Er...Do it for Janey!!!

DARIA: Hmmm... Okay...I'll go...

TRENT: THANKS... (Everybody looks at him; he blushes)
Huh... I'm sure Jane wanted to thank you... Didn't you
Janey?

JANE: Nope... she already knows it... (Trent looks very
embarrassed) Daria, will you come by yourself or I
have to ask to me
brother if he don't mind to give you a ride?

DARIA: I don't know... I think I'll wa...

TRENT: I'll take her Janey... Does it sound okay Daria?
I will take you at 8...

DARIA: Huh...That's alright!!! 

(They take their things and drive home. Trent stops
the car in front of the Morgendorffer's residence.) 

JANE: Bye, see ya soon...

DARIA: Yeah... in an hour... (Daria smiles)

TRENT: Bye Daria... See you on Friday night... or before,
if I don't sleep...

DARIA: (smiles) Yeah, I'll see ya... Bye Jesse...

JESSE: Good bye...

(Trent drive Jesse home and drive at Jane and his own
house.)

(Cut to the Morgendorffer's house)

(Daria takes off her clothes, then looks at her
quickly in the bathroom's mirror. (though: How would
Trent love you? You are so...
What am I thinking about? You have such a low
self-esteem Daria!!!) She opens the shower's door and
walks under the shower.
She starts washing herself and then, sits down and
starts to cry. A tear drops from her cheek and falls
onto the shower's floor.
(though: You are so stupid Daria... How could Trent love
you? Stop dreaming...) She finally stops crying. She
stops the shower
and gets dressed. She puts on jeans and a nice
dark-blue T-shirt. She goes in her bedroom when the
phone rings.)

DARIA: Hello?

JANE: Yo... How do you do?

DARIA: I'm fine Jane, and you?

JANE: I'm fine, but I'm not sure you are okay...

DARIA: Why do you say that? 

JANE: You look like you are in another planet... You
seem to be sad Daria... 

DARIA: I'm not... I'm all right, I told you...

JANE: Please Daria... tell me the truth for once please...
I think I know what's wrong with you... It is because of
your
low-esteem that you are like this... I'm sure that Trent
is involved with it too... Am I wrong Daria? (Daria
don't answer at all) I
knew it Daria; I just knew it...

DARIA: Don't make fun at me... please Jane... I really
don't like this at all tonight... At all... 

JANE: I am not making fun at you... Daria... you know what
I am thinking about? I think that you should tell
Trent about how you
feel...

DARIA: Shut the hell up Jane... Please... I don't feel
like you tell me this either... okay?

JANE: Okay... Do you want to come watching "Sick Sad
World" over my house?

DARIA: Okay... I'm going... Ciao...

JANE: Bye... 

(Daria walks to go at the Lane's house. Arrived there,
she knocks on the door. Trent opens it.)

TRENT: Oh, Hey Daria... (he smiles at her)

DARIA: (she blushes) Hey...

TRENT: How are you? 

DARIA: Not really good...

TRENT: What's wrong? 

DARIA: Nothing really important...

TRENT: You're sure?

DARIA: Yeah...

TRENT: I hope you'll be better soon! Oh... I was
forgetting... huh... Jane is going on a date with Jesse
tomorrow night, and I
was kinda wondering if you would like to do a little
something with me... maybe just, go to a movie or go
eating somewhere? 

DARIA: (she smiles a little) sure...

TRENT: So what do you want to do, see a movie or eat
somewhere and talk?

DARIA: I think I'll go for eating and talk... 

TRENT: K... I'll take you at 7... That's sounds okay for
you?

DARIA: Of course...

(Daria smiles to Trent. He smiles back to her. She
goes upstairs and knocks on the door. He looks at her
go upstairs and goes
back in his room when he can't see her anymore.)

JANE: Come in Daria... (Jane is painting. Daria opens
the door, then sits down on the bed.)

Part two: Daria's date

(Cut to Morgendorffer's residence.)

Daria can't decide what to wear. She tries too many
things. She can't take something in her clothes. 

DARIA: If only I had something different... 

(Quinn hears her sister, then enters in Daria's room...)

QUINN: You look like you need to borrow something? Am
I wrong Daria?

DARIA: Go to hell...

QUINN: Oh... sorry... I was just trying to help you for
once, but if you don't need it...

DARIA: Sorry Quinn... I'm worried because I have a date
and...

QUINN: You have a DATE???

DARIA: YES... 

QUINN: Oh... I see, and you want something to look well
in...

DARIA: If you wanna talk like this, it can be a good
point...

QUINN: Wait, I think I can help you... Wait a minute...

(Quinn goes in her room, looks in her closet, takes
something and goes back to Daria's room.)

QUINN: I got just what you need. (She hands a little
and very "short" blue T-shirt to Daria.) Oh... sorry, I
have to go I have a
date... Bye Daria... And Good Luck...

(Daria looks at the blue T-shirt. (Though: Do Quinn
really think I could wear this...) She tries it anyway.
She looks in the mirror.
(Though: I'm too fat to wear that thing...) At the same
time, Trent arrived at Daria's home. He rings the
doorbell... Quinn comes
and answers it...)

QUINN: Oh... you're Jane's brother right? Oh... you must
be here for Daria! She's in her room; you can go
upstairs... Oh... just
one last thing... knock on the door, she is maybe
getting dressed!

TRENT: Okay... thanks for the "advice"...

(Trent goes upstairs before anyone can see him.)

(Cut to the kitchen where Helen and Jake finish to eat
their lasagna...)

HELEN: Quinn? Who was at the door?

QUINN: Daria's date...

HELEN: Oh... okay... (After a long time) What? Quinn, did
you said Daria's DATE?

QUINN: Yes mom... I have to go... I've got a date...

(Quinn leave the room.)

(Cut to Daria's room when someone knocks on the door.
(Daria is still wearing the blue shirt)

DARIA: You can come in... (Daria stay back to the door.)
Oh... I think I'll give you back that T-shirt Quinn, I
look very bad in
it...

TRENT: Sorry, it's not your sister...

DARIA: (she turns to faces Trent.) Oh... sorry... I didn't
know you were here yet!

TRENT: That's okay! (He glances at Daria) You know,
you don't look that bad in this shirt...

DARIA: (she blushes) Thanks... (Though: He must just be
trying to be nice with me...) 

TRENT: Huh... Are you ready? 

DARIA: Umm... I guess...

TRENT: Let's go... 

(They walk to the door)

(Cut to Trent's car)

TRENT: Before we go, I need to know something. Where
do you want to go? Or just tell me what you wanna eat...


DARIA: I don't know... What do you wanna eat? 

TRENT: I don't know! I'm not really hungry...

DARIA: Wow... that's a miracle! (She puts her hand on
her mouth (though: I shouldn't have said that...)) 

TRENT: (laugh softly) Good one Daria... (She smiles)

DARIA: You know, I'm not really hungry either. My mom
forced me to eat my lasagna...

TRENT: So what do you wanna do? 

DARIA: I don't know...

TRENT: Wait, I've got an idea... but it's a surprise!

DARIA: Why? Why do you want it to be a surprise??? 

TRENT: You'll see Daria... Don't ask now... (Though: I
hope she will like my idea)

(Cut to a little park at about 20 minutes in car from
Daria's house.)

(They got out of the car.)

TRENT: Maybe it is not as far of Lawndale that we
could go and maybe it's not a place very popular, but
I like to come here
when I need to think or just get away from the people
I know. And maybe I just want to "share" this
place...huh... with you!!!
(He blushes and smiles at Daria who blushes herself.)
Daria, do you think it's possible to a guy to fall in
love with a girl younger
than him, same if that girl is his sister's
best-friend?

DARIA: (she blushes) Why are you asking me that?
(Though: what does he want to tell me? He loves me? He
is too clever for
that... it can't be the truth.) 

TRENT: (he blushes, then looks down) Huh... nothing... It
was just a question like that... 

DARIA: (looking a little sad) Oh... I see... (She smiles)
Trent?

TRENT: Yes...

DARIA: Do you think it's possible that a girl falls in
love with a guy older than her, same if that guy is
her best-friend's brother?

TRENT: I guess...why? (He glances at her (Though: What
is she saying? Or trying to say? Maybe that she likes
me... No way...
She is too clever to loves you, poor Trent!!!))

DARIA: I was trying to answer at your question...

TRENT: (looking depressed or something) Oh...okay...
thanks...

DARIA: Huh... that's nothing! Trent? Do you always care
about Jane's friend or I'm the only one that you don't
like to see her
alone? 

TRENT: (a little embarrassed) Umm... Actually, you are
Janey's first real friend... I mean that no one of her
ex-friend were
caring about her like you do... It's normal to her big
brother to care about her... and about her only real
friend... 

DARIA: Love declaration by a guy to her sister next on
"Sick Sad World"... (Trent laughs softly, then looks at
Daria.)

TRENT: Daria?

DARIA: (she looks at him.) hmmm...?

TRENT: huh... You're pretty cool... I mean... You are not
like the other girls I know...

DARIA: Huh, thanks... but I always knew I was not like
people of my age...

TRENT: I mean "all" the girls I know, not only girls
of 16 years old... 

DARIA: Oh...(she blushes and looks down)

(Cut to the restaurant where Jane and Jesse are eating
some slices of pizza.)

JANE: Where do you think that Trent and Daria are
right now?

JESSE: I dunno! Maybe at your house where they could
talk, or in a little restaurant where they can... talk
too...or I don't know...
What do you think about that?

JANE: I dunno either... why do you think I asked that?

JESSE: Oh... sorry...(He starts to kiss her and kiss her
and kiss her...)

(Cut to Trent's car, around 11:00(PM) when he drives
Daria home.)

TRENT: Thanks a lot, I really enjoyed your company
during this evening...

DARIA: Oh... That was nothing... What else did you want me
to do?

TRENT: Huh... you're right... (He stops the car, then goes
out of it to walk Daria to the door...)

DARIA: Thanks... for... "Take me away" from my family... 

TRENT: Really that was nothing, it should happen more
often... I had a lot of fun talking with you...

DARIA: Yeah... me too! (He puts his arms around her to
hug her and, without wanted it, he puts his hands on
Daria's skin, in the
bottom of her back.)

TRENT: Oh... sorry Daria...(but he doesn't put his hands
away... She blushes. Trent looks at her.)(softly) Daria...

DARIA: (she glances at him) hmmm? (Trent pulls her
closer and kisses her. Daria kisses him back and puts
her arms around him.
They stop kissing each other. Suddenly Helen opens the
door.)

HELEN: Daria, what the hell are you doing out at this
hour? (She looks at Trent) Oh, you are the brother of
that Jen?

TRENT & DARIA: Jane...

HELEN: Yeah... Jane... 

TRENT: I was just driving Daria home...

HELEN: Where is your sister?

TRENT: Oh... she is sleeping at home... She was not
feeling very well...

HELEN: Oh... the poor girl... Is she alone?

TRENT: No, my best-friend or, in other way, her
boyfriend is with her, she's gonna be alright...

HELEN: Okay... Daria... come on in...

TRENT: Bye Daria... See ya Friday...

DARIA: Yes, see you on Friday...

(Cut to the Morgendorffer living room.)

HELEN: How was your date Daria?

DARIA: Fine... can I go to bed now?

HELEN: Okay... we'll talk about it tomorrow morning?

DARIA: G'night Mom...

HELEN: Good night sweetie...

(Cut to Daria's room. Daria is lying on her bed and is
thinking...)

DARIA: (Though: Wow... I have a boyfriend... The guy I
really love and care about kissed me... Oh my god I
become crazy and
I'm even just thinking about it...)

(Daria falls asleep.)

Part 3 – The "road trip"

(Cut to the Morgendorffer living room the next day.
The phone rings. Quinn runs to it.)

QUINN: Hello?

TRENT: Can I talk to Daria please?

QUINN: Wait a minute...(to Daria.) DARIA... someone wants
to talk to you on the phone. It's that guy... your date
of
yesterday...

DARIA: Give me that phone... (To Trent) Hey...

TRENT: Hi, what were you doing? 

DARIA: Nothing...why?

TRENT: Jesse, Janey and I were going on a little "road
trip" for the day. We are going at a beach at about 2
hours from here...
Do you want to come?

DARIA: Sure...

TRENT: We'll take you in 15 minutes... I love you...

DARIA: I love you too...

(Cut to see Jane arrived in Trent's back...)

JANE: Trent, who the hell are you talking with? Who
come with us to the beach? You have a new girlfriend?
You forgot how
much you like Daria?

TRENT: Can I finish my conversation? Wait a minute
Jane... Hey, I'm back...

DARIA: Okay, I'll take my things and wait for you...
Bye...

TRENT: Yes... Bye... We won't be long...

(Trent takes Jane's arm and pulls her to the tank.
They sit and drive to Jesse's house. Trent stops the
van and go outside. Jesse
walks out of his house and goes talk to Trent.)

TRENT: Hey Jesse... I let you drive if you want to... of
course...

JESSE: Sure man... but what's wrong with you? You never
let anyone drive the tank...(Trent glares at Jesse. They
sit in the
tank.)

TRENT: (whisper) Jesse... drive to Daria' home okay, but
don't tell it to Jane... I want it to be a surprise to
her...

JESSE: Okay...(Jesse drives to the Morgendorffer's
residence. He stops in front of the house. Daria come
out and walks to the
tank.)

DARIA: Hey guys... 

JANE & JESSE: Hey Daria...

TRENT: Hey Daria... (He takes her by her hand and kisses
her. Jane and Jesse look at him in surprise.) 

JANE: They told each other their true feeling?

JESSE: I guess... Everybody's ready? (He looks at Jane)

JANE: Yes... (Then, looks at Trent and Daria in the
back. They are still kissing.)

TRENT: Mmm...Mmm... (Between two kisses) We're... (Between
two other kisses)...ready!

(Jesse starts driving.)

(Cut an hour later.)

JESSE: Somebody's hungry?

JANE: Yes... I'm hungry... And the too lovers? Are you
hungry?

DARIA: Yes I am... (She shakes Trent) Trent? Trent?
TRENT? 

TRENT: Huh? What? Oh... hey Daria... (He smiles to her.)

DARIA: Hey... Are you hungry?

TRENT: Huh. Yes...

(Jesse stops the car in front of a little restaurant.)

(Cut to the restaurant where they are sit at a table
and eating. (Daria is not eating lasagna.))

JANE: So when did you two tell each other? I wanna
hear the whole story...

TRENT: Yesterday...

JANE: I said the WHOLE story...

DARIA: Trent took me out. When we return, in front of
my house at about 11:00PM Trent hugged me and kissed
me and that's
all...

JANE: You did that? How? What's happened with you? Did
you become crazy?

TRENT: Shut up Janey... (He glares at her. Immediately,
she starts to laugh.)

TRENT: Hey... Why are you laughing? (Before she answers
anything, Jesse starts to kiss her.) 

(Cut to the tank where Jesse and Jane are kissing in
the back. Trent is driving and Daria is listening to
him as he talks.)

TRENT: Do you think they will stop kissing each other
before we arrived at the beach? You know what Daria? I
really love you...
I mean that you're not like the girls I know. I know
that you listen to me when I talk... Like right now! You
don't talk but I know
you listen to me... Even when I try to talk to Jane...
except when I was talking about you... I'm never sure if
she listen to me... I
just love you, as you are Daria...

DARIA: I love you too Trent...

JANE: Oh... what's that... Trent I really thank you for
what you said about me... You know... same if you don't
talk to me... I
hear... 

TRENT: Sorry Janey...

(Cut to the beach where they find a perfect place to
sit. They put their towels on the sand and open one
umbrella. Jane takes off
her clothes and jumps in the water. Jesse follows her.
Daria and Trent sit down on their towel for some
time.)

TRENT: When do you wanna go?

DARIA: I don't know! I don't go if I'll go... 

TRENT: Please, do it for me!

DARIA: Okay... but first, I need to change my clothes... 

TRENT: Okay... I'll wait for you...

DARIA: I'll be back...

(Daria gets up and start walking. Trent looks at her,
then lie down and falls asleep.)

(Cut to the bathroom. Daria takes out a black bikini
of her bag. She puts it on.)

DARIA: (though: I feel so weird wearing that...) (She
comes out the little bathroom and looks at her in the
mirror.) (Though: I'm
too fat to wear that.)

(She walks in Trent direction still asleep on his
towel. Jane runs to him with some water in a glass
then let the water falls on him.
Trent wakes up and starts screaming to Jane. Daria
laugh a little. A guy comes to her and pulls her by
her arm.)

DARIA: Hey... let me alone...

GUY: Why... a beautiful chick like you should have a
boyfriend! Come with me in my car and you'll see... I
have a lot more to
offer that I show right now...

DARIA: LET ME ALONE... 

(Trent hears Daria screaming. He gets up and runs to
her.)

DARIA: HEY PUTS YOUR HAND OFF ME AND LET ME ALONE... 

TRENT: You didn't hear her? Let her alone...

(The guy is still touching Daria's breast. Trent
becomes very angry.)

TRENT: TAKE YOUR DIRTY HAND OFF MY GIRLFRIEND NOW... 

GUY: Oh... Because that beautiful chick is the
girlfriend of a guy like you... I don't believe it... (He
starts touching Daria
again...)

DARIA: Let me go... Don't touch me... JESSE... JANE... HELP...

(Jane and Jesse hear Daria's scream and start running
in her direction...)

GUY: Oh... another cute chick... Thanks to call your
friend baby...

(Jesse kisses Jane...)

GUY: Oh... she is taken... I'll keep you anyway...

(Trent, very mad, closes his eyes, then opens them. He
takes a good breath and hit the guy. The guy who looks
very strong falls on
the ground and shows how he really is. He is not very
solid. Trent takes Daria in his arms to protect her.
The big guy gets up...)

GUY: Okay... you won... (To Daria) but don't think I will
forget you... baby...

(He walks off. Jesse, Jane, Trent and Daria all comes
back to their towels. Trent puts some sunscreen on
Daria's back. He softly
hugs her. She sits down on Trent's legs. She puts
herself some sunscreen on her arms and legs.)

(Cut to the tank at 8:00(PM). Trent is driving and
Daria is sleeping. Jesse and Jane are still kissing in
the back.)

(Cut an hour later. Trent stops the car in the parking
of a little restaurant. )

TRENT: Jesse... it's your turn to drive... I'm really
tired and I'm really scared to kill everyone if I fall
asleep as I'm driving...

JESSE: Just say that you want to be in the back with
Daria... I understand that.

(Jesse and Jane sit down in the front of the car...
Trent and Daria sits on the loveseat in the back. Both
of them fall asleep.
Daria's head is on Trent's shoulder.)

JANE: Oh... aren't they cute? 

JESSE: Yeah... They are very cute. 

Part 4 – The party

(Cut to Daria's room. She talking on the phone...)

DARIA: Jane I told you I don't know what to wear... I
don't have anything except my usual clothes and you
ask me to wear
something else. 

JANE: You're a liar! 

DARIA: What???

JANE: My dear brother Trent told me how you were
dressed on your date and it doesn't fit what you said...

DARIA: It's Quinn's shirt...

JANE: Oh... because you borrow Quinn's clothes now?

DARIA: Shut up... I didn't want to wear it but Trent
said he liked it...

JANE: Oh... you do it for my dear brother...

DARIA: Shut the hell up Jane...

TRENT: (offscreen) Yeah Janey... Stop bothering Daria...
Oh... and tell her that I love her...

JANE: Hey Trent! You wanna talk to her?

TRENT: 'Kay... (Pick the phone) Hey Daria...

DARIA: Hey...

TRENT: I just wanted Jane to tell you that I love you
but... anyway... I love you...

DARIA: Me too...

JANE: (offscreen) Oh... isn't it cute...

TRENT: Shut up Janey... I have to go... see ya "Honey"...

DARIA: (smiles) Bye (Trent hands the phone to Jane.)

JANE: Hey... Oh... cute nickname "Honey"

DARIA: (at the same time than Trent) Shut up Jane...

TRENT: (at the same time than Daria) Shut up Janey...

(Cut to the Lane's house when the doorbell ring. Jane
opens it to find a weird-looking Daria. She's wearing
contact, she's wearing
a green skirt and a black little T-shirt and her hair
are separated in the middle of her head.)

JANE: (not really looking at Daria) Yeah... Who are you?
Trent's guest? Or someone else guest?

DARIA: Jane's best friend, Trent's girlfriend and a
Mystik Spirals' Fan...

JANE: Daria? Wow... You look great... Where are your
glasses? Where did you get those clothes? Borrow
Quinn's?

DARIA: No... Shut up...

TRENT: Jane can you call Daria? I have to know when to
go take her! (To Daria) Oh... Hey! (To Jane) A new

JANE: Yeah... this is my brother Trent... Trent, this is
my new best friend...Daria Morgendorffer...

TRENT: New best friend? What about Da... Daria? Wow... I'm
sorry! I didn't recognized you...

(Cut to 3 hours later... Jane and Jesse are STILL
Kissing, Daria and Trent talk and kiss and all the
guest are laughing and
talking...)

DARIA: Trent? I love you...

TRENT: Me too. (They kiss...) Daria? You want to go out
of this a little?

DARIA: Yeah...

(Trent takes Daria's hand and leads to his bedroom. He
closes the door behind them. They sit on the bed and
start kissing again.
(-I hope you don't expect me to put sex in my story!
Sorry... I'm not that kind of writer. -) Trent takes his
guitar and starts singing
something he just wrote a few days ago... A ballad he
wrote for his new girlfriend.)

(Cut 2 hours later. All guests are gone. Trent, Jane,
Jesse and Daria are watching the mess...)

(Cut to 1 hours later... They finish their clean up.)

JANE: Oh God... who had the idea to invite Upchuck... He
was a real jerk. He didn't stops interrupting Jesse
and I...

DARIA: I guess nobody... in us... invited him... 

JESSE & TRENT: No... Daria's right...

JANE: I hope so...

The end...
