<p><b><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Purple Eyes and Other
Interesting Anomalies<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>If you have read any of the statistics of my
Daria-based fan fiction characters or any of my stories about those characters,
you will have noticed that three of my characters (Raven, Rebecca, and Zia)
have deep purple eyes. It's not because they wear contacts in order to hide
their real eye colors. It's because of a genetic mutation called
&quot;Alexandria's Genesis.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>The Origins of the &quot;Genesis&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>&quot;Alexandria's Genesis,&quot; as it has
been called since the 1960s, is a genetic mutation generally found in women of
Euro-American (a.k.a., Caucasian) descent. This mutation can be traced as far
as the Middle Ages in Northern Europe. The first known record of
&quot;Alexandria's Genesis&quot; was written in the year CE 1330 (Common Era). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>A woman named Alexandria Augustine came into
the world on April 29, CE 1329 in London, England. At the time, she appeared to
be normal, but her parents soon noticed that her eyes were changing from the
blue eyes Alexandria had at birth to the purple eyes she would have by her
first birthday. The parents were startled by this dramatic change. They took
her to their priest, thinking that a witch did this to their child, and that
the priest might be able to ask God to change the eye color back. The priest
told the parents that it was not the work of the devil, but a myth come true.
This particular priest had heard a story about a race of people who had purple
eyes. These humans were thought to have come from Egypt after a mysterious
light flashed in the sky during a moonless night thousands of years ago. The
purple-eyed humans also had very fair skin, and were thought to be spirits
because of their appearance. The so-called &quot;spirit people&quot; eventually
went north and vanished without a trace. The priest told her parents not to
worry, for they had a special child in their hands and they should take good
care of her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Eventually, Alexandria grew up to be a very
beautiful woman, got married, had four children (all four were girls, and all
four also had the mutation), never got sick, and died at the age of 150 of
natural causes. It is this discovery that helped to name the genetic mutation
when the gene was discovered in 1968.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>The Characteristics of &quot;Alexandria's
Genesis&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>The first characteristic of people with
&quot;Alexandria's Genesis&quot; is their eye color. When someone is born with
this genetic mutation, the eyes are either blue or gray at birth. At six
months, the eyes begin their transformation from the original color to purple.
This process is completed by the person's first birthday. A second process,
where the eye color deepens, starts as soon as the first is completed. This
slow process continues until the onset of puberty. By then, the eye will have
become a dark purple, a deep purple, a royal purple, or a violet-blue color,
and will be that color for the rest of their time. These changes do not affect
the person's eyesight, though. If anything, the eyesight is, and remains until
death, 20/20.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Speaking of puberty, those who have the
mutation will never grow <i>any</i> facial, body, pubic, or anal hair during
this stage of growth. In fact, the only hair they will ever have is what is on
their heads, in their ears and nose, their eyebrows, and their eyelashes. Women
also have an added bonus beyond never having to shave: never buying tampons or
pads. It turns out that females born with &quot;Alexandria's Genesis&quot;
never menstruate in their lives. They are fertile, however, and can go through
the same things that women without the mutation can go through every month.
Beyond these differences, those with the mutation go through puberty as
normally as everyone else does.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Below are all of the characteristics of
&quot;Alexandria's Genesis.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Clear, silver-like purple eyes (after 1<sup>st</sup>
birthday; deepen in color until onset of puberty)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>No facial or body hair growth beyond what
was already there at birth<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Dark brown or black hair<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Shimmering white skin that resist tanning
and burning<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Lack of menstruation cycle (in women)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Highly evolved immune system (has been known
to resist <i>every</i> disease known to man so far)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Appear 5-20 years younger (after the age of
21, the aging process slows down greatly; it stops completely between the ages
of 40-50)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Long life span (ranges from 130-170 years)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Perfect vision<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Never overweight (their metabolism prevents
the gaining of too much fat [a.k.a., partial lipodystophy])<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Well-developed and proportioned bodies<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Found mainly in women of Euro-American
descent<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Women are the primary carriers of the
mutation<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Children born from mothers with the mutation
are also carriers<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Mutation remains active generation after
generation<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Mutation grows stronger generation after
generation<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>Interracial Children of the
&quot;Genesis&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>An interesting aspect of this mutation is
that if it passed on to a child whose mother or father is not of Euro-American
descent, the child will receive all of the qualities of those who have the
gene. The only quality that changes is the skin color; it is lighter than those
without the gene are, but it is not as light as the parent with the mutation
is. So far, this gene has shown up in children whose mother or father was
Hispanic, Asian, or Arabic. If these children were to marry someone within
their own race, their offspring would also develop the same characteristics.
The most startling aspect of the biracial &quot;Genesis&quot; children is that
they take on a more Euro-American appearance. Not much more is known about
these children beyond these initial findings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>Another Interesting Development<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>In ten percent of the population that has
&quot;Alexandria's Genesis,&quot; there is another characteristic of this
mutation that is increasing on a yearly basis: the processing of human waste…
or lack thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>As it turns out, in some of these people,
the mutation is actually causing the digestive system to produce <i>no waste</i>.
No one has found out how this is possible, but most scientists have a theory
that may explain this increasing phenomenon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>The digestion process goes through its
normal procedure until the digested product enters the large intestine. It is
there, scientists suggest, that the large intestine absorbs <i>everything</i>
and uses the product to keep the body in top shape. This makes the bladder
completely useless, and leaves the small intestine and rectum as just an
opening. It is not much of a theory, since very little is still known about
&quot;Alexandria's Genesis.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>Conclusion<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>There are questions about this genetic
mutation that remain unanswered. The biggest question left unanswered is where
&quot;Alexandria's Genesis&quot; actually first appeared. Many researchers are
looking into the myth of the &quot;spirit people&quot; of Egypt in order to
find out if this mutation really did exist several thousands of years ago. If
that is indeed the case, the next question to be answered is if this mutation
is of Earth origin… or of a different place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
