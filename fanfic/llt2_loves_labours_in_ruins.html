<p class=MsoNormal>On the night of our first date, James met me outside of my
dorm one hour before the play was to begin, tickets in hand.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was unpleasantly surprised to see him
in fancy dress, not tuxedo or suit and tie, but a nicer outfit than his usual
casual dress for class.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He seemed
to be taking this outing pretty seriously, and I wasn't quite sure what to make
of this new side of him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately for him, I'm not Quinn; I don't judge dates by their
outfits, and I wondered why he thought I would prefer him this way.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Surely he knew me well enough to know
that I would not expect it, and certainly would not be impressed by it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So why go through the trouble?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At least there was no flower in his
lapel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Combined with James's red
hair, that would have been a little too close to an Upchuck flashback for me to
endure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After an afternoon of torment, I had finally decided to
listen to my inner Jane -- or at least the voice in my head that took on that
persona -- and take this chance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
had decided that I wasn't all that happy being the exact same Daria I had
always been, retreating and nursing my wounds after every relational collision;
that if college was a time of growing, maybe it was time I force myself to do
some of my own.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What made the
situation particularly sticky was that it had taken me several hours to come to
this shaky resolution, and once enough of my mental powers were freed to think
of anything beyond my own problems, I realized that James had probably not
spent the time in joyous celebration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The memory of his face as I had turned and walked away from him, with
only a murmured and distressed farewell to acknowledge his continued presence,
was enough to put another twist in the Gordian knot that was my stomach.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If I called on the phone to tell him of
my choice, he might very well not answer; if I waited until our next class
together, several days hence, my own determination would probably fade.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had to tell him in person, and I had
to tell him immediately.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>James's dorm is on the east side of campus, a long walk
through the cold night air from my own west side room.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That night, though, the temperature
didn't register on my mind, which was far more concerned with perfecting my
opening statement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had to convey
acceptance without obligation, affection without commitment.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He had to know that, though we were
friends, this date was on a purely trial basis, and that I could make no
promises about how I might feel about him during or after.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After both Ted and Tom, I couldn't just
jump into this relationship to see where it might take me; I couldn't make the
same mistake a third time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was
going into this one with eyes open and mind engaged.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I was taking a chance, but there was no reason to take it
blindly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then I was standing at his door, my fist rapping upon the
wood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was a simple, normal
knock, but I fancied that it sounded uncertain and nervous.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then he was standing there, his
greeting dying on his lips.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
blood drained from his face so fast it was as if a tap had been plugged into
his jugular and the spigot opened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Neither of us moved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had
thought it bad when my words had failed me on my Bromwell interview; that was
nothing compared to the shroud that now descended on the speech centers of my
brain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Where were all of my
carefully prepared sentences, the declarations that were to grant me total
security and serenity in this encounter?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I . . . I think we should go out," I stuttered out, after
what seemed an eternity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Very
slick, Morgendorffer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mature and
eloquent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Why don't you just go
all the way and ask him to go steady, maybe pass him a note in homeroom with a
box to check yes or no?</i><span style='font-style:normal'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>James blinked twice in response.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"That sounds like a very good idea," he slowly said, his
voice hoarse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Though his face was
still pale, and tinged with even a little bit of green, his mouth curled up in
a smile.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He had to swallow before
he could continue his reply.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"Tomorrow night, then?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There's a local theater troupe doing <i>Troilus and Cressida</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> within walking distance of here.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Um . . . we can have pizza afterwards."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"That sounds . . . good," I replied, brain still in neutral,
and promptly ran out of new words to say.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well, great," he replied, just as briefly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Goal achieved, and with no more words left in me, it was
time to cut my losses and escape with some dignity intact.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well, bye then," I said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"OK.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>See you
then, I guess."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My mind had made its decision, but my legs kept me still at
his door, the two of us staring at each other across the threshold.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An increasingly uncomfortable silent
minute passed, then finally I managed to stumble backwards, turn, and walk
speedily away, already in the grip of doubt and anxiety.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Oh, yeah, this is off to a great start.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next night, James and I left my dorm and moved towards
the theater.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>James was overflowing
with information about the play, its history and cultural impact, slipping in
details he had heard about this particular production.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His drawl was distinctly more rapid
than usual, its pitch a couple of notches above normal.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Normally, such unceasing conversation
would annoy me, bearing an unpleasant resemblance to Quinn's never-ending
supper-table rambles, but his talk filled what would likely have been an uncomfortable
silence, and so I was grateful for it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, even in the best of times, he loved to talk Shakespeare, and
even though there was little that he said on that walk that I did not already
know, after a while I began to sincerely enjoy his spirited dissertation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Troilus and Cressida</i><span style='font-style:normal'>
is a strange beast, one of the oddest of Shakespeare's plays.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It wasn't even performed until the
mid-nineteenth century, both because of its demanding stage directions and
because no one seemed quite sure what to make of it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It starts off looking like a romance or a comedy, and ends
up as something more closely resembling tragedy.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It even veers wildly between characters, like it can't make
up its mind whose story it is actually telling.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It's not one of the Bard's best plays, but it is among his
most interesting, in the same manner that a four-car pile up is
interesting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'd read the play, of
course, but never actually seen it performed live (outside of the movies, I'd
never seen any of Shakespeare's works performed, and it was just as well -- if
the great acting talents of Lawndale High couldn't even handle O'Neill's
bastardization of the Canterbury Tales, then I shudder to think what they would
have done with Hamlet or Macbeth, or even Titus Andronicus -- though Kevin would
no doubt have loved all the severed limbs in that one).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was starting to believe that this
might actually be a tolerable evening after all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And, for a while, it was.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>When the lights went down and the play began, it suddenly
was as if we had slipped back into Chemistry class, sitting in our adjacent
seats, eyes forward, but low voices aimed towards each other, commenting on
everything that passed before our eyes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Habit dies hard, and in this case, that was a very good thing.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even with a play like <i>Troilus</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>, this was still Shakespeare, so there was little we
could say about the writing; but the editing, casting, acting, and direction
were all suspect, and James and I had as much fun picking all of them apart as
we would have viewing a competent production, maybe more.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All the awkwardness of the past day was
gone, and we were once again two friends amusing ourselves the best way we knew
how.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I thought that I could begin
to understand what Jane was always seeking out with her boyfriends, the elusive
idea of just having "fun".</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then I felt it, a light touch on my hand, followed by a
full-fledged clasp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Automatically,
every muscle in my body stiffened, and without any conscious direction, my hand
yanked itself out from under his, and flew into my lap.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I heard a sharp intake of breath, but I
did not dare to move my eyes from the stage.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It took a few seconds for me to realize what had just
happened, and once I realized it, I didn't know what to do next.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>None of what I had just done was
intentional, none of it was planned; if I had anticipated James's attempt to
take my hand, I would not have felt comfortable with it -- Ted had never so much
as touched me, and despite our initial kiss, Tom hadn't even attempted a
handholding on our first official date -- but I would have told him my feelings
in advance, and let him down as easy as I knew how.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Despite all of the uncertainty and frustration he had
recently caused me, I had no desire to hurt him.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But the damage was done, and now that the action had been
taken, my feelings followed suit; under no circumstances did I want James to
touch me now, or even to acknowledge my existence.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I could feel myself withdrawing from him, even though there
was a part of me that didn't want to, that wanted to laugh off this one unfortunate
incident and continue on as before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But a more basic instinct had taken over -- he's gone too far, he's
crossed the line, he's moved too fast, and now it's time to run and hide.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So I just sat there rigidly, to all
outer appearances focused intently on the drama before us, while in reality internally
roiling in fear of hearing James's voice in my ear, or feeling his touch on my
arm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thankfully, James seemed to realize as much, and left me
alone for the rest of the play.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No
more camaraderie, no more shared smirks or quiet chuckles, just an impossibly
tense silence filled only by the voices of the actors on the stage, which were
now just an unintelligible drone in my ears.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Afterwards, we stood outside the box office, not quite able
to look each other in the eye.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>James was the first to speak.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I guess I really screwed things up, didn't I?" he mumbled,
head slightly bowed and his voice choked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>His adam's apple jumped up and down several times, and his breathing was
heavy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What could I say to a question like that?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There was a part of me that agreed with
him, and was all for telling him so in no uncertain terms; he acted like an
idiot, like the hormone-crazed teenaged boy that was almost all I knew at home
and which I had so desperately hoped for him not to be, and he should suffer
for it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But my own damnable
honesty, that conscience I had always so desperately denied and yet which still
had an iron hold on me, made sure I knew that this was not so.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He had in ignorance hurt me, and I in
reaction had hurt him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The great
relationship cycle had claimed another victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>There really was nothing new under the sun, not for me
anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It's not just you," I said, doing my best to look him in
the eye.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But all I could see there
were Trent's eyes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ted's.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Tom's.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And now I had another name to add to my list, another fellow
hedgehog who had attempted to approach me, only to leave me pricked by his
quills.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And him by mine, as
well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"It's me, too."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>God, I never thought to hear such a
cliché come out of my mouth, but it was all too true.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I suppose dinner's off," James said, filling the quiet with
the obvious.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>No, I would love to savor this feeling over a good meal
and a glass of wine.</i><span style='font-style:normal'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I thought it, but I didn't say it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It would have been like kicking a
puppy, and I had no desire to take on the role of serial puppy kicker, not
without Quinn around.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since we
were reduced to stating the obvious, I thought I would take the next turn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I think you should go now," I said, and watched as his face
winced at the dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I'll
give you a five minute head start for the school, and then make my own way
back."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The corner of his mouth
twitched in a gallows smile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Doesn't seem proper to take a lady out and then not walk
her home."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He intentionally
broadened his South Carolina accent.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"My mother'll kill me when she finds out."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His attempt at a smile faded, and the
forced humor left his voice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I'll
see you in . . . I'll see you sometime."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>With that, he turned and walked off, feet shuffling and head down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And now he's out of sight, and I'm walking through the cold
dark, alone, wondering how I could have ever thought that I was ready for
this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maybe it's just not been
enough time since Tom; maybe I'm not enough over that relationship to start a
new one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Or is it something
deeper, something fundamental about my psyche that turns every attempt I make
at a boyfriend into disaster and eventual pain?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>My mother once told me that I judge people by too high a
standard, one I couldn't always live up to myself.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Is that part of it?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Am I expecting every relationship I have to be perfect, and when it's
not, I destroy it as unworthy?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If
I had made more of an effort, could I have shaken off my discomfort, calmly
told James that I was not yet ready for such an overt gesture of affection, and
then moved on as though nothing had happened, trusting in his good will and
good sense to hold him to it?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
gave up Ted after one mistake.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
tried to do the same over and over with Tom, and it was only his persistence
and refusal to accept my rejection that kept us together. <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>James didn't even try, but I don't think
I ever pushed Tom away with such severity as I just did to James tonight; what
was he supposed to think?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It seems like guys always assume that it's the women who
know what they're doing, that they're creatures of mystery, who know all the
rules and are working behind the scenes, pulling all the strings and making the
men dance to their will, in full control of the situation.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bullshit.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I have no clue what I'm doing.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I've just broken something, and I have no idea how to fix
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm going to walk into class
next Tuesday, and maybe James will be in his usual seat.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maybe he'll say hello.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maybe I'll even say it back.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But that will be it.<span
