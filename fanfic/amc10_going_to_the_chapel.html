<P>It had been a long hike and Jake's feet ached. If it hadn't been for
Willy's constant banter about Hilda he would have spent most of the fifteen
miles complaining, so he was thankful for that. </P>

<P>While the sun set they pitched their tents under the watchful eye of
Corporal Ellenbogen.</P>

<P>&quot;You two!&quot; Ellenbogen grunted. &quot;Latrine duty.&quot;</P>

<P>Jake turned to see who his partner was going to be in the dismal job
of digging the pit and erecting the multi-hole seat over it.</P>

<P>Kowalski.</P>

<P>Jake groaned inwardly as their eyes met. Kowalski and Jake had avoided
each other since the night out, which Jake was thankful for, assuming that
Kowalski was giving him a wide berth in case Jake laid him out again. And
Jake was happy to have him think that - knowing that, without the rage
he, couldn't go two rounds with a revolving door. Leaving Willy to finish
setting up the tent, Jake retrieved the collapsible shovel from his pack
and followed Kowalski to the edge of the clearing that Ellenbogen had pointed
to.</P>

<P>Kowalski stuck his shovel into the soft ground and looked Jake in the
eye. &quot;Okay then, Morgendorffer. What's it gonna be?&quot;&nbsp;he&nbsp;asked.</P>

<P>Jake made an instant decision to tough it out. &quot;You got what was
coming, Kowalski. Helen was my date. Groping's bad enough, and she gave
you a cold shower for that. But if you think I was gonna stand there and
watch you hit her, then you'd better get used to it because its not gonna
be the last time someone lays you out.&quot;</P>

<P>Kowalski met Jake's stare for a few seconds then looked away. </P>

<P>&quot;So let's forget about it and dig this shitter or we're gonna be
here until midnight.&quot;</P>

<P>To Jake's relief, they did.</P>

<P>By the time they'd dug the pit, set up the seat, and erected the canvas
screen around it Jake was tired and famished. He walked back to where Willy
had the tent erected, waiting for &quot;Cooky&quot; to get the dinner ready.
He was in the middle of telling Willy about the accommodation that he and
Kowalski had reached when he was stopped mid-sentence by a sublime aroma.
Turning, he saw Cooky, Buxton Ridge's head cook, stirring a large pot over
a low fire, steam rising into the cooling air. Jake's mouth watered and
he dragged Willy over to where the evening's meal was being prepared.</P>

<P>&quot;That smells great! What is it?&quot; Jake asked, his taste buds
tingling in anticipation.</P>

<P>Cooky looked up from the pot. He recognised Jake as the boy who'd spent
last Christmas at Buxton Ridge. Morgan? Morgandorf? Something like that.
He cocked a wary eye at Jake. &quot;Kitchen sink stoo. 'S what I call it
anyways.&quot;</P>

<P>'Kitchen sink? As in 'everything but'?&quot;</P>

<P><I>No, white bread - 'cause it looks like what's left in the sink after
the washin' up. </I>&quot;Yeah Sure.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Do you suppose I could...?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Taste it? Sure. You hungry then? How about your buddy?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That smell soooo good! And I could eat a horse,&quot; Jake enthused.</P>

<P>&quot;Uh, it ain't spicy is it, Cooky? I reckon you're about the best
damn chef in all of creation, but I like m' food plain and simple.&quot;</P>

<P>Cooky cocked an eye at Willy.</P>

<P>Jake watched hungrily as Cooky ladled a dollop of stew onto two enamel
plates and handed them to him and Willy with a spoon each. Jake held it
to his nose and breathed in a hearty lungful of the aroma, then eagerly
shovelled a spoonful into his mouth. He closed his eyes as the taste hit
and a beatific smile welcomed the angels dancing on his tongue.</P>

<P>Cooky watched, grinning. &quot;You like it? Uh, Morgandoofer is it?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Morgendorffer - Jake,&quot; Jake replied, eagerly eating the rest
of the plateful. &quot;Like it? I don't think I've ever tasted anything
so good in my life!&quot;</P>

<P>Cooky snorted. &quot;An how 'bout you, son?&quot; he asked, looking
at Willy.</P>

<P>&quot;Well, I dunno - it smells a little spicy t' me...&quot;</P>

<P>Jake grabbed Willy's plate and finished it off in a trice, to Willy's
delighted laughter. &quot;Yeah, Willy! That's real spicy - you wouldn't
like it at all! Tell you what - you'd better give me yours later too!&quot;</P>

<P>Willy laughed louder. &quot;Well - you done saved me a night o' stomach
troubles then, Jake.&quot;</P>

<P>Laughing, Jake turned back to Cooky. &quot;I don't suppose you'd...you
know...teach me to make it?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Teach you? Yeah. Sure!&quot; Cooky's funny bone tingled and he
looked around, making sure that no-one was near, and turned back to Jake.
&quot;Not now though,&quot; he whispered conspiratorially. &quot;It's a
family secret. I'm only gonna tell you 'cause you like it so much. Come
back after dinner and I'll...impart the wisdom to you!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Wow!&quot; Jake said, open-mouthed. &quot;Thanks! I'll be back!&quot;
Jake grinned and he and Willy hurried off back to the tent.</P>

<P>Cooky watched Jake walk off. He grinned and chuckled to himself as he
bent to pick up the catering-size cans of Chef Boy-Ar-Dee Hungarian Goulash
and stash them away before the boys lined up, almost sorry that he'd have
to admit that it came out of a can. Why couldn't Morgendorffer have said
that about his chicken gumbo or his apple pie?</P>

<P>Once things had been cleared up he walked off to his tent to fetch a
packet of cigarettes, unaware that the exchange had been observed by someone
who was looking forward to getting even with Cadet Jake Morgendorffer.</P>

<P>Kowalski waited until Cooky was in hearing range, and spoke to his friends.</P>

<P>&quot;I can't believe Morgendorffer, man. He said, 'Thats some damned
good cooking for a nigger. Hell - he probably stole the recipe from a white
man.'&quot;</P>

<P>Cooky stomped off and Kowalski smiled. &quot;Perfect,&quot; he whispered.</P>

<P>George Curtiss &quot;Cooky&quot; Washington had been head cook at Buxton
Ridge since just after the war. As an army cook he'd been what he expected
to be, a black man in a white man's world, and he'd been called a nigger
too often to take it personally any more. No doubt Morgandoof was just
another ignorant white kid, and Cooky bore him no malice - what could you
expect from a kid whose parents left him at school over Christmas anyway?.
The racial prejudice in the army was a damn site less than he'd been used
to as a poor kid growing up in Alabama - and it'd taught him a useful trade.
When he'd been demobilized at the end of the war Corporal Ellenbogen had
offered him the job at the Academy and he'd taken it with pleasure, married,
and built a life that a lot of the folks he'd grown up with would have
envied. Besides - there were changes happening in America - Doctor King's
Freedom Marches, Black Power...he could see that it was going to be a long
road, but maybe his kids or his grandkids would grow up with all the opportunities
that these pasty white kids like Jake Morgendorfle and his smartass buddy
had. Hell, maybe they'd even be able to go to a place like Buxton Ridge
where some white guy would be doing the cooking for them! He smiled at
the thought of Morgendorter being that white guy, cooking up a mess of
kitchen sink stew.</P>

<P><I>So,</I> he thought, chuckling to himself, <I>Morganfoofer wants kitchen
sink stew? Then kitchen sink stew he's gonna get.</I></P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="25%"></P>

<P>The Willys bounced as Vincent left the driveway and turned onto the
street perhaps a little too fast. Amanda was silent, lost for words, torn
between relief that they were leaving and regret for the rift that she'd
precipitated between Vincent and his family. </P>

<P>As they turned left at the end of the street she turned to look at him.
His face was set, not betraying any emotion, but tense. </P>

<P>&quot;Vincent, I'm sorry,&quot; she said.</P>

<P>Vincent's expression didn't change and he stared straight ahead, but
he reached across and took he hand, lifted it to his lips and kissed it.
&quot;I meant what I said.&quot; He paused, letting go of her hand to change
gears, and continued quietly. &quot;I didn't realise...how goddam bourgeois
they...we were...are.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;If you hadn't met me...&quot;</P>

<P>He turned to her and shook his head, then turned back to the road. They
slowed as a car in front turned into a driveway. &quot;Being away from
them, getting out into the real world - I would have changed anyway. I
just hadn't realised...I thought it was them, but it wasn't, was it?&quot;
</P>

<P>He was speaking quietly, and she assumed the question was rhetorical
and didn't bother answering.</P>

<P>&quot;Sooner or later something would have triggered it. I'm sorry it
had to be you.&quot; He took her hand again and squeezed.</P>

<P>&quot;The ring...&quot;</P>

<P>He sighed. &quot;Yeah.&quot; A faint smile lit his face. &quot;Well,
we'll just have to get another one.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Did you really mean that? About a wedding?&quot; She smiled. &quot;Another
wedding?&quot;</P>

<P>He turned to her, serious again. &quot;Yeah. Definitely. The sooner
the better. In fact...why not now?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Now? What...you mean here?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No,&quot; he laughed, &quot;but...&quot; another pause &quot;...it's
Tuesday. What do you say Saturday?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But how...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Vegas.&quot;</P>

<P>Amanda stared at him. &quot;You're kidding?&quot;</P>

<P>Vincent grinned back. &quot;No. Look - at first I wanted a big wedding,
the whole family thing, you know, the public declaration of love and commitment.
But what happened...back there...made me realise that Coyote was absolutely
right - except for one thing.&quot; </P>

<P>&quot;Legality? But that's just...convention. I mean if you take away
the religious significance.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Is it?&quot; he said, looking at her again. &quot;How did you
feel when Mom almost called Wind a bastard?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I was going to...&quot; she stopped, realising that telling him
that she was about to leave - and would have if he hadn't come back early
- would mean that she'd have to answer difficult questions about what had
been said. And as much as she despised his mother, telling Vincent about
what she'd done stood too big a chance of hurting him, so it was going
to stay her secret. &quot;It hurt. You're right.&quot; She flushed with
anger at the memory but, luckily, he didn't ask what it was she was going
to do.</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah. Me too. If we get legally married in Vegas we'll protect
them. Quick, easy, no problems. So what do you think?&quot;</P>

<P>Amanda stared at him as he concentrated on the road. &quot;I think I
love you Mister Lane.&quot;</P>

<P>He grinned. &quot;Then let's get married, Mrs Lane.&quot;</P>

<P>Three days later they drove down Las Vegas Boulevard, Amanda goggling
at the spectacular casinos and hotels. But when Vincent turned into the
parking lot of Caesar's Palace she turned to him. &quot;Now come on - this
is crazy. This is Caesar's Palace! There's no way we can stay here!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Relax,&quot; he grinned. &quot;These places are cheap. The casinos
subsidise the rooms. Most of the people who come here wind up playing the
tables and that's where they make their money. You'll see.&quot;</P>

<P>They parked underground and took the elevator up to the foyer. As Amanda
looked around she realised that it wasn't so much opulent as ostentatious
- ornate and expensive, but tasteless and gaudy. The mock-Roman effect
was more a Cecil B DeMille Rome than something that Romulus and Remus's
descendents might have recognised. Still, the detail and decoration were
impressive. And she realised a little guiltily that she couldn't help feeling
a thrill at being part of such a classically cheesy scenario - the quickie
wedding in Vegas. She smiled at the thought and waited while Vincent went
up to the desk to see about getting a room for the night, watching the
people, many of them probably desperados, she thought, hoping for that
lucky number to raise them from desperation to riches. <I>I wonder how
often it really happens, </I>she thought<I>.</I> Banners advertising the
current show were hung from the faux-Roman pillars, photographs of stars
and the rich and famous.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Wind was gurgling happily at all the colour and
movement, and Amanda was about to say something to him when a scuffle across
the floor attracted her attention.</FONT></P>

<P>&quot;Watch where you're going you old fool!&quot;</P>

<P>She turned to see an old woman go sprawling as a plaid-suited man in
his 20s stormed off, ignoring her, the expression on his face suggesting
that Lady Luck hadn't smiled on him. The old woman's handbag and glasses
went flying, the handbag's contents spilling out across the carpet.</P>

<P>Amanda ran across to her and knelt down, holding Wind in one arm and
gently helping the old lady to sit up with the other. She reached out to
snatch the glasses from under the feet of people hurrying by, missing them
by a second as they shattered with a crunch under the heel of a pair of
highly-polished wingtips. Amanda glared up at the retreating legs and turned
back quickly to support the woman..</P>

<P>&quot;Are you alright?&quot; she asked.</P>

<P>&quot;My glasses - my things...&quot; the old woman said, her thin hand
reaching out to where her belongings had spilled.</P>

<P>Amanda handed her the frame of what had been, until a minute ago, her
glasses. &quot;I'm afraid these aren't going to do you any good. Don't
worry - I'll get the other things. Can you stand up?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I think so, if you can help me up,&quot; the woman said, getting
shakily to her feet with Amanda's help. As soon as Amanda let her go, she
staggered, and Amanda put an arm around her again.</P>

<P>&quot;Here - let's get you to a seat,&quot; she said, helping to steer
her to a black leather couch a dozen paces away.</P>

<P>&quot;But my things...&quot; the woman said, increasingly distressed.</P>

<P>&quot;I'll get them. You help her to sit down.&quot;</P>

<P>Amanda looked up to see a middle-aged man with dark wavy hair wearing
well-cut casual clothes picking up the handbag and starting to fetch the
spilled contents. She helped the woman to the chair and sat down next to
her, seeing that the old lady was badly shaken and beginning to cry.</P>

<P>&quot;I'm so sorry. It all happened so quickly - I...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It's okay,&quot; Amanda said soothingly, holding her hand. &quot;The
important thing is that you're alright. Nothing broken? Not badly hurt?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Only my pride,&quot; she said, smiling through her tears. </P>

<P>&quot;Can you see without your glasses?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well enough, thank you Dear. I have a spare pair in my room. Things
are a might fuzzy but I can see to get around.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well at least that's something. People can be such pigs!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I'm afraid so. But others,&quot; she said, looking at Amanda,
&quot;are very kind.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Here you go,&quot; said the dark-haired man, handing her her handbag.
&quot;Everything seems okay, but I don't think this'll ever be the same
again.&quot; He smiled, holding out a lipstick that had been trodden on.
&quot;Maybe this'll teach you to be more careful! Las Vegas is no place
for pretty young ladies like you to running around and tripping over themselves!&quot;</P>

<P>The old lady laughed, reaching into her handbag for a handkerchief.
&quot;It's been a long time since anyone's called me pretty. Say - don't
I know you, young man?&quot; </P>

<P>Amanda looked up and grinned at the man, who winked at her.</P>

<P>&quot;Nah, I've just got one of those faces. People think they recognise
me all the time, but I don't know any of them.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well thank you so much. I'm so grateful to you. Are you both here
for the show?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, sure. I'm looking forward to it,&quot; he said.</P>

<P>&quot;I'm here to get married,&quot; added Amanda. &quot;My hu...my
fiancee's over there getting us a room now.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh dear!&quot; The woman looked at Wind, and caught a blurry glance
from the man. &quot;I mean I don't think he's going to have any luck. The
whole town's booked out for the show,&quot; she said, wiping her eyes.</P>

<P>Amanda's face fell. &quot;Oh no,&quot; she said. &quot;We've driven
three days and we...&quot; Wind started fussing and Amanda rocked and shushed
him, not noticing the exchange of glances between the dark-haired man and
the woman.</P>

<P>&quot;I'm sorry, he's probably hungry.&quot; Amanda said, glancing over
at the desk to see Vincent speaking despondently to the clerk, nodding
in resignation.</P>

<P>&quot;Well, I'll leave you folks to it then,&quot; the dark-haired man
said, turning his head round to glance at Vincent. &quot;Are you sure you're
alright, little lady?&quot; he asked.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, yes, thank you, I'm fine. Thanks to you two,&quot; she replied.</P>

<P>He picked up the woman's hand and kissed the back of it. &quot;See you
later, beautiful,&quot; he said, smiling at them both and walking off leaving
the woman giggling like a thirteen year old.</P>

<P>Amanda stifled a laugh as Vincent turned and, spotting Amanda, walked
over to them. None of them noticed the dark-haired man circle around behind
them, walk over to the desk where he had a brief word to the clerk, and
disappear into the crowd.</P>

<P>&quot;This is my fiancee, Vincent,&quot; Amanda said, winking at Vincent
as he in response to his reaction to the word.</P>

<P>&quot;Hello, Dear! Your fiancee was very kind to me. I fell and she
helped me up. You're very lucky.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, she's something alright,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm lucky
that way, but I'm afraid we won't be staying here tonight. There's a big
show on and the whole town's booked solid.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh dear, I was afraid of that,&quot; the old woman said. &quot;We
were just talking about that. Everyone's here for the show. What are you
going to do?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well, I&nbsp;guess we could try Henderson or Boulder City, but...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Excuse me, Sir.&quot;</P>

<P>Vincent turned to see the desk clerk behind him.</P>

<P>&quot;It seems I was mistaken,&quot; he said politely. &quot;We do have
a room. If you'd like to come and register I'll have the bell boy help
you up with your luggage.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, that's great! Thanks!&quot; Vincent said. &quot;Come on, let's
go then.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Are you sure there's nothing you need?&quot; Amanda asked the
old lady.</P>

<P>&quot;I'm fine, thank you, Dear. You run along now,&quot; she said,
slowly getting up and standing steadily. &quot;I'm fine. Congratulations
on your marriage.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Thank you,&quot; Amanda said, smiling and hurrying to catch up
with Vincent.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="25%"></P>

<P>&quot;So, ya wanna learn how to make Kitchen Sink Stoo, eh?&quot; Cooky
had spent the last two hours preparing for this and he was going to enjoy
it. He played up the Delta dialect to make himself sound more exotic.</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah! That was soooo good. I hope it's not too complicated.&quot;
said Jake, patting his distended stomach.</P>

<P>&quot;Listen, Morgendorffer, ya don't make a masterpiece in a minute.
Sure, I can whip it up pretty quick when I needs to, but I been doin' it
since I was at my Daddy's knee. These things take time.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh - yeah. Sorry,&quot; Jake said looking abashed.</P>

<P>&quot;Okay then. Now listen up good. Ya takes ya some ham hocks and
some chicken livers and ya boil 'em danged near ta death, then yo put in
a few handfuls of shrimp and crawdad butts...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Crawdad butts? Where do you get crawdad butts from?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Ain't my problem, Morgendorffer. You wants t' make it, you works
out where t' git it. Now - once them crawdad butts are in there ya gotta
be quick. Y' tosses in a few handfuls of okra and then...you listenin'
hard, cause this here's the secret?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah - I am!&quot; replied Jake, drinking in every word.</P>

<P>&quot;Okay then. You takes some cayenne pepper - 'bout a half a cupful,
and y' adds it real quick. Then, while that's boilin', y' chops up about
a cupful 'a chillies - you know them tiny little ones...&quot;</P>

<P>Jake nodded. He'd never heard of cayenne pepper, but he knew only too
well what chillies were - Mad Dog used to put them in his chilli con carne
and it made Jake's eyes water to be in the house when it was cooking. He
knew that the smaller the chillies were the hotter they were, and he started
to feel uncomfortable.</P>

<P>&quot;...y' chops 'em up real fine and you tosses 'em in and stirs it
real good. Now you waits until all that okra's rendered down real thick
and then y' adds jist the tiniest dash o' hot sauce. Y' gotta use Durkee's
'Red Hot' Sauce or 'Louisiana'-brand hot sauce if y' can get 'em. Not too
much, mind! If it don't work out right y' can be sure it's 'cause y' messed
up the hot sauce - y' gotta git that jes' right!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Uh, won't all that chilli...I mean it didn't taste like it had
any chilli...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well 'course it didn't, Morgendorffer! Damn, boy, you real dumb
- you know that? That's what the cayenne pepper's for! All them things,
they jes' cancel each other out! Your buddy, that smartass kid - he jes'
real sensitive. Y' gotta have a little bitta bight to it or it ain't no
good at all - s'why y' gotta be real careful with the hot sauce. You understan'?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Wow! Yeah! I get it!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You sure? 'Cause lotsa white folks jes' don't understsan'. But
I can tell as how you're a lot smarter'n most 'un 'em. I reckon as with
a bit a' practice you're gonna be able to make this jes fine!&quot; <I>Lawsy
me, Cooky - y'all shoulda bin a actor 'stead o' a cook,</I> he thought
in dialect, biting his tongue to stop himself from laughing.</P>

<P>&quot;Really? Thanks! So that's it?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah. Tha's it.&quot;</P>

<P>Jake reached out and shook Cooky's hand. &quot;Thanks, Cooky! This is
something I'm going to remember all my life! I'm going to get it perfect,
just like you do, if it's the last thing I do!&quot;</P>

<P><I>It well may be, son, it well may be. I just hope you aren't stupid
enough to try it out on other people.</I></P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="25%"></P>

<P>&quot;Your bags, Sir?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It's okay - they're still in the car. We didn't want to bring
them in until we'd checked.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I'll show you to your room then, Sir, then I'll come and bring
your luggage in from the car for you.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Wow - great service!&quot; said Vincent. &quot;Sure. Thanks.&quot;</P>

<P>The bellhop led them to the elevators inserted a key into a lock below
the button panel. Amanda glanced at Vincent, who shrugged his shoulders.
A set of elevator doors opened immediately. When they were in the elevator
doors closed and they felt the familiar slight weight increase as it started
upwards. Vincent noticed that there sixteen floors and he watched the numbers
climb on the floor indicator - 14, 15, 16 - and then the display blanked
while the car kept moving what felt like another two floors before the
doors opened.</P>

<P>They stepped out - not into a hallway, but directly into a room. From
the mezzanine level where the elevator stopped, a wide flight of marble
stairs led down to a sunken living area with curved sofas upholstered in
what looked like zebra hide. A polished black granite coffee table held
a huge vase of exotic flowers and, beyond them, floor to ceiling windows
looked out across Las Vegas to the Nevada desert beyond.</P>

<P>&quot;Whoa,&quot; Vincent exclaimed, grinning at the bellhop, &quot;wrong
floor, man! But this is amazing! Could we take a look around do you suppose?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;This is the suite I&nbsp;was told to show you to, Mister Lane,&quot;
he answered.</P>

<P>&quot;But you...there's no way we...&quot; Vincent stuttered as Amanda
stepped out onto the polished marble floor, looking around, her eyes drawn
to the paintings on the wall.</P>

<P>&quot;Vincent,&quot; she whispered, &quot;these are...originals...&quot;
Patting Wind gently she slowly walked up to one, her eyes bulging.</P>

<P>Vincent stepped out after her and turned to see her staring at what
could only be a Picasso. He turned back to the bellhop, who had stepped
out of the elevator. &quot;Look, man, they've confused us with someone
else, but do you think we could stay here for a minute while you go and
sort it out for us? My wife's an artist and she'd love to look at the paintings.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;And the...ooooohhhh no! Rodin!&quot; she said, skipping over to
a statue that overlooked the living area.</P>

<P>&quot;Certainly Mister Lane. I'll go and confirm with the desk. Why
not give me your car keys? If I'm right, I'll go and fetch your luggage
and bring it up. If there's a mistake I'll come back and show you to the
proper room.&quot;</P>

<P>Vincent reached into his pocket and tossed him the keys. &quot;Thanks,
man. Red Willys wagon.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Thank you, Sir. I won't be long.&quot;</P>

<P>The bellhop got back into the elevator while Amanda and Vincent slowly
walked around the suite. While Amanda looked at artworks that would have
done a small museum proud, Vincent checked out the furniture and the view,
hoping that Amanda wouldn't noticed that the upholstery was real zebra
hide.</P>

<P>A chime behind them signalled the return of the elevator and rhey turned
to see the bellhop taking their luggage off a trolley. &quot;Here are your
car keys, and these,&quot; he said, handing him two small keys, &quot;are
the room and keys to the private elevator. There are phones in every room
including the bathroom. Twenty-four hour room service is complimentary...&quot;</P>

<P>'Whoa - hold it!&quot; Vincent interrupted. &quot;This is crazy! I mean
even if it wasn't a mistake there's no way we could afford it!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I anticipated your concern, Mister Lane, so I double-checked with
the desk. The management regrets that you were turned away when you first
enquired and offers you this suite by way of apology for two nights at
the standard Deluxe Room rate of $25 per night. If that's acceptable to
you, the suite is yours.&quot;</P>

<P>Vincent glanced at Amanda. Her eyes said &quot;please take it&quot;
and...other things. Vincent turned back to the bellhop. &quot;Look, man,
I have no idea what this is about but I'm not crazy. You're sure, right?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes, Mister Lane. I'm certain.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Then we're here for two nights. Uh, just for the sake of curiosity,
how much does this room normally go for?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Normally, Sir? Well, it depends. It's usually reserved for VIPs.
In casinos that means high rollers - people who can be relied on to bet
thousands of dollars a night - sometimes more. The casino offers them the
use of these suites free of charge. For - pardon the term , ordinary guests
- people the casino doesn't know, it would cost in the vicinity of eight
hundred dollars a night.&quot;</P>

<P>When he could speak again Vincent said &quot;I still think there's been
a terrible mistake. I've never gambled and I don't intend to. Even if I&nbsp;did
the most you'd get out of me would be five dollars. But...okay. You're
absolutely sure I'm not going to find a nasty surprise waiting for me...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Vincent. Shut up. It's happened. Take it.&quot; </P>

<P>Amanda's expression was irresistible and, bowing to the inevitable,
Vincent smiled and handed the bellhop a dollar, which he took with dignity
and a friendly smile. As he left, Amanda put her arms around him, being
careful not to squash Wind, who was gurgling happily. &quot;I want to find
out what those knobs on the bathtub are,&quot; she said.</P>

<P>

<P>Jake tolerated the three days of camp by focussing on two things: he
had only four weeks to go until graduation and this weekend he was going
to take Helen to her senior prom. Getting the recipe for kitchen sink stew
from Cooky was a bonus.</P>

<P>Now that Hilda had accepted his proposal Willy talked incessantly about
his plans. And though Jake enjoyed listening to him and sharing his contentment,
it wasn't without an accompanying regret. Sometimes at night he'd concentrate
on picturing Amanda's face, and he cried silently the first time he realised
that tiny details were fading. But they never faded completely.</P>

<P>&quot;Army's a fine life for a guy like me, Jakey. Not fancy, mind,
but regular.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;How about 'Nam, Willy?&quot; Jake had asked the first night under
canvas.</P>

<P>Willy had been silent for a long time before he answered.</P>

<P>&quot;I don't think so deep as you, Jakey, I know. I don't much care
about politics. T' be honest I'm not sure as I could point out Viet Nam
to y' on a map. But Pa always said that y' gotta clean out the stables
if y' wanna ride the horse. I guess what he meant was that if y' take the
pay, y' do the job, right?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jake had said, feeling deep conflict over loyalty
to his friend and revulsion that he'd consider participating in what Jake
was coming to know was a deeply unjust war. &quot;I guess so,&quot; he
added, loyalty winning out.</P>

<P>&quot;Anyways, I talked t' Hilda about it an' she's fine. Kinda likes
the idea of movin' round t' where they post me. She's never done much travellin'.
Ma's not so happy about it o' course. I&nbsp;think she'd like me t' stay
and mind the farm. But Peter's talkin' about moving back in an' Ma's real
keen on that. I hope he does. It'd make me real happy to know that Ma's
got folks there with her.&quot; He turned over and looked at Jake. &quot;Ma's
lookin' forward a heap t' meetin' ya at the wedding.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I'm looking forward to meeting her too, Willy,&quot; Jake had
replied honestly.</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>Cooky prepared an early breakfast on the morning of the hike back to
Buxton Ridge.</P>

<P>Growing up as an only child Jake had always hated the shared latrines
that they set up at camp, so he'd avoided using them as long as he could.
But immediately after breakfast it became obvious that he wasn't going
to be able to wait any longer and, sighing in resignation, he made his
way to the canvas enclosure that he and Kowalski had erected three days
ago. The ashes of the cooling fires were spread on the pit daily, but they
never really masked the smell.</P>

<P>As he trudged towards the latrine he didn't notice the surreptitious
glances of half the cadets, nor that two of them dashed in before him.
Five minutes later Jake came out and walked over to wash his hands at the
tank. The two cadets who had gone in before him came out, looked to their
left and shrugged their shoulders at Kowalski, who had been watching from
inside a tent on the eastern side of the latrine. He crawled out and strode
past the two, glaring at them, and into the latrine.</P>

<P>Thirty seconds later there was a yell, and the canvas screen around
the latrine came crashing down. From underneath the collapsed screen came
a string of invective and Jake turned to see the entire camp making for
the source of the commotion. He hurried over to help the other two lift
the remains of the screen off to reveal Kowalski, sitting in the pit and
scrabbling to get out, the three-hole wooden seat broken in two along a
clean line between the second and third holes.</P>

<P>Years from that day, new cadets would stare wide-eyed at at the story,
and beg to be told again of the day that Kowalski (who, it was rumoured,
had had serious anatomical problems) fell in the pit.</P>

<P>&quot;But why didn't y' fall in y'self, Jakie?&quot; Willy asked. &quot;That
seat'd been sawed nearly right through.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You're kidding?&quot; Jake said. &quot;You actually <I>sit</I>
on it? I thought everyone sort of...hovered...like I do. Don't you get
splinters?&quot;</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="25%"></P>

<P>Wind screamed with delight as Amanda bounced him up and down, in and
out of the frothy, bubbling water, watched by a grinning Vincent who was
lying back letting the jets of air streaming out of the nozzles behind
him massage his back. &quot;I wonder what the poor people are doing?&quot;
he mused.</P>

<P>&quot;Peeling grapes for the feast, I hope,&quot; she replied, handing
Wind to him and ducking her head under the water. A couple of seconds later
she came up and brushed her streaming hair back off her face with her hands.
Vincent reached out and took her hand, pulling her over towards him, She
lay next to him, her face flushed with the heat of he water as Wind kicked
his legs and laughed.</P>

<P>&quot;It could have been like this...well, maybe not at $800 a night,
but...you know...the hot tub, the peeled grapes...&quot; He looked around
at the room and back at her face, her pale hair stuck to her shoulders
with the water. &quot;All I had to do was to become President of Lane Automotive
Finishes.&quot;</P>

<P><I>But you'd have had to do it without me,</I> she thought. &quot;Is
it what you want?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No,&quot; he answered immediately. &quot;God! I can't think of
anything more boring.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But all this...&quot; she looked around.</P>

<P>&quot;I've got all I want,&quot;&nbsp;he said gently, staring into her
eyes as their lips met.</P>

<P>Half an hour later they climbed out of the tub, enjoying the sensation
of standing naked before the floor to ceiling windows looking down on the
town below and the lengthening mid-afternoon shadows of the reddening desert
beyond.</P>

<P>&quot;I guess I'd better go down and organise the wedding,&quot; Vincent
said as he towelled off. &quot;I hear it takes all of ten minutes so there
shouldn't be too much of a wait.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I might go and take a look around.&quot;</P>

<P>Amanda dressed herself and Wind after Vincent had left. As she buttoned
his top she was seized by an irresistible urge that seemed to come out
of nowhere. She picked him up and walked over to the zebra skin-upholstered
seat next to the coffee table (<I>not real zebra skin, </I>she thought,
<I>still, an incredibly good imitation...)</I> and, picking up the telephone,
dialled a familiar number, her heart pounding, fighting the urge to hang
up as the line clicked and buzzed.</P>

<P>&quot;<I>The number you have dialled is not available or has been disconnected.
Please check the number and try again...</I>&quot;</P>

<P>The colour drained from her face and she slowly put the receiver down,
staring blankly into space.</P>

<P>&quot;Ma ma ma ma ma,&quot; gurgled Wind.</P>

<P>She walked slowly over to him and picked him up as if in a dream, drifted
across to the elevator and pressed the button. The door opened a minute
later and she got in and pressed the button for the lobby. Stepping out,
the people walking by and milling around barely registered, but the movement
and bustle were distracting, taking her mind off it. <I>The number you
have dialled is not available or has been disconnected...</I></P>

<P>She looked around, wondering where Vincent had gone, and walked aimlessly,
bouncing Wind gently. After perhaps ten minutes of random wandering with
no sight of Vincent she sat down on a sofa in a bar, where it was quieter
and people were talking quietly or sitting at the bar nursing drinks. <I>The
number you have dialled...</I></P>

<P>A tear dropped from her eye.</P>

<P>&quot;You look as if you could use this.&quot;</P>

<P>She looked up to see the man who had picked up the old woman's purse.
He put a scotch glass down in front of her, full to the brim with ice cubes
and pale golden liquid., identical to one he held in his hand.</P>

<P>Amanda wiped an embarrassed hand across her cheek. &quot;Thanks,&quot;
she said, sniffing and smiling at him, &quot;but I can't - I'm pregnant.&quot;</P>

<P>He cocked an eyebrow in an expression that was both comical and charming
at the same time. &quot;It's iced tea.&quot;</P>

<P>She looked down at the glass, picked it up, and took a hesitant sip,
then a longer one. &quot;It's delicious! Thank you!&quot; She smiled.</P>

<P>&quot;That's more like it,&quot; he said. &quot;Okay, so it's none of
my business, but what's a young lady like you doing crying on her wedding
day? Do you mind?&quot; He said, indicating the seat next to her.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, no - please...&quot; she said as he sat down. She lifted the
glass to her lips again, enjoying the coolness of the lemon tea and peering
into the glass. &quot;It's a long story,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;It's...my
parents. I wanted to call them but I couldn't get through...&quot;</P>

<P>He nodded, as if to say &quot;go on.&quot;</P>

<P>He had the kind of open and honest face that made her relax. &quot;I...sort
of...&quot; she looked at Wind.</P>

<P>&quot;Can I guess?&quot; he asked gently. &quot;Not married, baby on
the way, parents couldn't accept it. My guess is that you ran away.&quot;</P>

<P>She stared at him. &quot;How did you...?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It's not all that hard to figure out. I'm Italian and my parents
were strict about that kind of thing too. Roman Catholic?&quot;</P>

<P>She nodded.</P>

<P>&quot;It figures. Not Italian though?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Irish.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Ah. Same thing,&quot; he said, winking at her.</P>

<P>Amanda couldn't help smiling.</P>

<P>&quot;He's cute,&quot; said the man, looking at Wind. &quot;May I...?&quot;
He reached out for him and Amanda passed him over.</P>

<P>&quot;His name's Wind.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Nice!&quot; he said, bouncing Wind up and down and making faces
at him to Wind's delight. &quot;My friends call me Dino,&quot; he said,
smiling at her.</P>

<P>&quot;Amanda, Amanda Lane - or at least I will be.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;So when's the wedding?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I don't know. Vincent's arranging it now. I guess it's too late
for today, so I'm hoping tomorrow.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You found somewhere to stay then?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Somewhere?&quot; She laughed. &quot;You wouldn't believe! It was
the most incredible thing! We were...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Is this meshugganah goy bothering you, Madam? I'd be happy to
call security and have him thrown out,&quot; came a voice from behind her.</P>

<P>She turned to see a short black man with close-cropped curly hair grinning
at her.</P>

<P>&quot;Don't you pay any attention to the Rabbi, here,&quot; Dino said
to her, &quot;You go and find yourself a nice Jewish girl. This one's taken...and
not by me! Amanda, this is my buddy, Sam. Sam, Amanda.&quot;</P>

<P>Sam walked around in front of her, took her hand and kissed it. &quot;Delighted,
my dear.&quot;</P>

<P>Amanda laughed. &quot;The pleasure's all mine, Sam.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;And this little bundle of Irish-American joy,&quot; added Dino,
bouncing Wind on his knee, &quot;is Wind.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You're letting him hold your baby?&quot; Sam said in mock horror.
&quot;I wouldn't trust him. Listen - I can call a Mohel, one little snip
and, bingo - protection from the papists!&quot;</P>

<P>Dino rolled his eyes, looking at Amanda with a resigned expression.
&quot;I can't take him anywhere without having him attack the one true
faith!&quot;</P>

<P>Amanda clamped her hand over her mouth to stifle her laughter.</P>

<P>&quot;That's better,&quot; said Dino, grinning at her. &quot;Sam, this
lovely lady's getting married in the chapel tomorrow.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well,&quot; said Sam, sitting down opposite her, &quot;my heartiest
congratulations on choosing someone more appropriate than this Italian...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hey,&quot; interjected Dino, &quot;since your parents won't be
here, who's going to witness the marriage?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Witness?&quot; Amanda asked.</P>

<P>&quot;You need witnesses. The Casino can usually get a couple of staff
to do it, but they charge ten bucks a head. If you haven't got anyone organised
maybe Sam and me could...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh! That'd be great! Thank you!&quot; she said, grinning. &quot;You
said you work here, Dino - and you, Sam?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, me too,&quot; said Sam. &quot;But I'd love to come. Mind
you, I always cry at weddings. Well - at Jewish weddings anyway.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Uh oh,&quot; said Sam, holding Wind at arm's length, &quot;I&nbsp;think
someone needs a change of diaper.&quot;</P>

<P>Amanda blushed and, standing, took Wind from him. &quot;Sorry, Dino.
Uh - I don't know when the wedding's going to be.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It's okay - they post a list on a notice board outside the chapel.
We'll check in the morning and if we don't see you beforehand we'll just
arrive. Don't you worry.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Thank you so much,&quot; Amanda said quietly. &quot;I didn't expect,
uh,&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I know,&quot; Dino said. &quot;Vegas isn't exactly the friendliest
place. The way you helped that little old lady yesterday...well, It's a
pleasure to meet you, Amanda.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;See you tomorrow,&quot; she smiled, and hurried back to the elevator.</P>

<P>When she arrived Vincent was sitting on the sofa and he turned and smiled.
&quot;All organised,&quot; he said. &quot;Ten fifteen start, out by ten
twenty in time for the next one at ten thirty. They don't waste any time.&quot;
He walked over to where she'd lain Wind down to change his diaper. &quot;We
need a couple of witnesses though. The casino can usually get some staff
to do it for ten dollars each providing it's not too busy so we'll...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh,&quot; she said, looking up at him. &quot;Get me the diaper
bag would you? Anyway, it's okay. You know I told you about that nice man
who helped with the old lady? He was in the bar and he bought me an iced
tea. He's so sweet. I was telling him about the wedding and his friend,
Sam, came and sat with us He said we'd need witnesses and he and Sam offered
to come.&quot; She smiled as he came back with the diaper bag. &quot;You
should have heard them - they were a couple of natural comedians - I was
laughing so hard. They must be on the night staff I guess.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Great! Then I guess we're all set!&quot; Vincent said.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="25%"></P>

<P>Helen looked at her watch. She had ten minutes to get from the hairdresser's
to the dress shop across the other side of town and she couldn't afford
to be distracted by the thoughts that had kept her awake half the night.
That this was to be the first time her father and Jake were to meet was
the least of her problems.</P>

<P>She checked the mirror and pulled out behind a blue Lincoln, immediately
realising that she'd made a mistake as it ambled along at twenty. Helen
impatiently hugged its bumper, getting more and more agitated as its driver
refused to speed up or pull over and let her pass. Finally she turned right
into a side street and stepped on the gas. She cut left, paralleling the
road she'd left, then left again, hoping that she'd be able to pull out
in front of the Lincoln. But, as it usually does at times like these, the
universe conspired against her and the Lincoln drove through the intersection
just as she got there and pulled back in behind it. </P>

<P>&quot;Damn!&quot; she breathed, hitting the wheel with her fist.</P>

<P>Finally she pulled in out side the dress shop with a screech of tires
just as the door closed. Throwing the car door open she ran up and knocked,
to see the woman inside turn and, recognising her, walk back and open the
door.</P>

<P>&quot;Miss Barksdale - you only just made it!&quot;</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>Jake stepped back and looked in the mirror.</P>

<P>If he had anything to thank Mad Dog for it was for having the foresight
- or at least the simple desire to screw the system - to have been insured
up to the hilt when he died. Still, Jake had been used to living on a shoestring
and now that money wasn't a problem he didn't spend it profligately - but
he hadn't stinted on the rented tuxedo or the orchid corsage. He straightened
the purple velvet bow tie one last time and headed back into the dorm to
put his toothbrush and toothpaste away.</P>

<P>&quot;Whoo-ee, Jakey. You're lookin' sharp as a knacker's knife.&quot;</P>

<P>Jake grinned at Willy, who was lying back on his bunk. &quot;Gonna be
a big night, Willy.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I surely do hope so, buddy. You have a good time now.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I mean to, man,&quot; he said and, hearing the cab's horn sound
outside, strode off.</P>

<P>As the cab pulled up outside Helen's house the cabbie turned to look
at Jake in the back seat. &quot;Hey - I remember you! I brought you and
your buddy here a while ago? How's he doin'? Has he managed to - you know...?&quot;</P>

<P>Jake reached over and gave him the fare, shaking his head sadly. &quot;I'm
sorry to say that it's gone from bad to worse. He really got himself in
the shit a couple of days ago at camp.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well,&quot; the cabbie said, &quot;I hope it comes out for him.
He's a lucky guy to have buddies like you.&quot;</P>

<P>Jake smiled, and he stepped out of the cab and walked up the path to
the Barksdale's front door.</P>

<P>Arthur Barksdale poured himself a scotch and waited for the doorbell
to ring. It wasn't so much the constant stream of boys - dogs gathering
around bitches on heat - that bothered him. That was inevitable and he'd
had a few years to prepare himself for it. But he wanted the girls to end
up with decent boyfriends, at least potential husbands, and all of the
ones that they - that Rita, to be honest - had brought home had been pissant
phonies.</P>

<P>When it came down to it, Arthur thought, taking a sip of Chivas and
letting it slide down, he'd prefer it if they'd just come out and say what
they were after. At least they wouldn't play those damn games, imagining
that he couldn't see through them as if they were plate glass. Pissants.</P>

<P>And now Helen. Soon it'd be Amy. And then just the two if them again.
It was a relief when the doorbell rang - his thoughts were getting morbid.
Carrying the scotch he walked over to the door and opened it, taking in
Helen's date at a glance. <I>Rented tux, lurid purple bow tie, hm - shiny
shoes, looks as if he's used to dressing neatly.</I></P>

<P>&quot;Hi Mister Barksdale. I'm Jake Morgendorffer, Helen's date for
the prom.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Come in, son. She won't be long I expect. Have a seat,&quot; Arthur
said, showing him in.</P>

<P>Jake thanked him and sat down, trying to seem as relaxed as possible
and thinking of the swimming duck - calm on the surface and furious activity
underneath.</P>

<P>&quot;Pour you a drink, Jake?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, uh, thanks, Mr Barksdale. No - I don't drink.&quot;</P>

<P><I>That's one point, </I>Arthur thought. <I>None of Rita's dates has ever
refused.</I></P>

<P>&quot;So, Jake. What do you do?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I'm a cadet at Buxton Ridge, Sir.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh? I'd expect you to wear your dress uniform to something like
this, not a rented tuxedo.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Er, well, Helen's not exactly...let's say military-minded. She
didn't say anything to me but I thought she'd prefer this.&quot;</P>

<P><I>Thoughtful.</I> &quot;Mm. That's Helen alright. So what do...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh wow,&quot; Jake interrupted. He stood up, walked over to the
credenza, and picked up a model airplane. Turning to Mister Barksdale he
said &quot;You build model planes? This is beautiful!&quot;</P>

<P>Arthur stood up and walked over to Jake. <I>Uh oh - here we go. The games
start. </I>&quot;Thanks. You like model aircraft?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah - well, I used to. But I've never made anything as good as
this.&quot; He turned it over, admiring the detail.</P>

<P><I>Let's just see, shall we?</I> &quot;The P38 Lightening. Quite a plane.&quot;</P>

<P>Jake looked at him nervously. &quot;Uh, Mr Barksdale, this is a Northrop
P61 Black Widow, not the Lockheed Lightening.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh?&quot; Arthur cocked an eyebrow.</P>

<P>&quot;Well, they're superficially similar, I mean they both have twin
tail booms but the P61 had a more rounded nose and a bulbous canopy - if
you look closely...&quot; He turned to Arthur. &quot;But, uh, if you built
this model you must know...&quot;</P>

<P>Arthur smiled. &quot;Just my little joke, Jake. I...&quot; He noticed that
Jake was staring past him, his mouth open, and he turned to see what he
was looking at.</P>

<P>Helen stood at the bottom of the stairs. She was wearing dress of soft
mint green that clung to her upper body then suddenly flared at the waist.
Its slender spaghetti straps were covered with a short bolero jacket that
clasped together low across her neck. The dress fell just short of her
ankles where a pair of dyed-to-match heels gave her an inch or two in height,
her hair pulled up in a French twist revealing a pair of tiny pearl drop
earrings. Delicate copper-coloured ringlets cascaded down her face.</P>

<P>Jake and Arthur stood in stunned silence as Helen's eyes flicked back
and forth between them, waiting for a sign of what their first meeting
had been like. </P>

<P>Jake slowly walked up to her, his heart beating like a triphammer, holding
the corsage in front of him with both hands. As he neared her he discerned
a faintly exotic scent - one, he was sure, that never came out of a bottle.</P>

<P>Arthur watched in disbelief, staggered at how beautiful his eldest daughter
looked, but still analysing their interaction. Jake's honest and respectful
correction had scored him some serious points, and all the indications
so far was that this one wasn't like the ones that Rita had brought home
(<I>never more than once</I>, he thought). But this would be telling.</P>

<P>Staring wordlessly into her clear brown eyes, Jake slowly raised the
corsage. &quot;You're beautiful,&quot; he breathed.</P>

<P><I>God, isn't she?</I> Arthur thought, his own heart beating faster,
remembering how Maureen had looked twenty-five years ago. <I>She was beautiful
too. </I>He felt a lump come to his throat.</P>

<P>Helen blushed, suddenly feeling the weight of her father's and her...boyfriend's
(?)...gaze. She gently reached out and took the corsage and looked down
at the perfect white orchid, back to Jake's still-staring eyes, and over
to her father. &quot;Dad?&quot; She breathed, holding it out for his inspection.</P>

<P>Arthur gathered himself, and walked slowly over to them. He took the
corsage, looked closely, and smiled at Jake. &quot;It's perfect, son.&quot;
Then, looking back at Helen, he said &quot;And so are you.&quot; He opened
the clear plastic case that the flower came in and turned to Jake. &quot;May
I...?&quot;</P>

<P>Jake tore his gaze away from Helen to see what Arthur was talking about.
&quot;Oh - yeah - yes, of course!&quot;</P>

<P>Arthur gently lifted Helen's jacket and pinned the orchid on, then stepped
back to look.</P>

<P>Arthur and Jake turned to each other...and smiled. Arthur held out his
hand and Jake took it, gripping firmly. </P>

<P>&quot;Look after her, son.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You can count on it,&quot; Jake said quietly.</P>

<P>&quot;Well now, isn't that touching?&quot;</P>

<P>They spun round to see Amy standing next to Maureen, who looked as if
she half way between a smile and the desire to scold Amy. Behind them,
Rita stood leaning against the door frame, a bored expression on her face.</P>

<P>Amy walked into the room and looked Helen up and down. &quot;Gee. It's
amazing what that yearly bath'll do!&quot;</P>

<P>Flicking her gaze back to Jake, who laughed as her mother breathed &quot;Amy!&quot;
in horror, she said &quot;You scrub up pretty well too, General Patton.
If I was thirty years older I'd go for you myself!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;If you were thirty years older, Kiddo, you'd be my mother,&quot;
laughed Jake.</P>

<P>Arthur stared at Amy's return smile, intrigued at the lack of rancour
between them. On the few occasions she's spoken to any of Rita's dates
she'd carved them up like a Thanksgiving turkey - not that they were sharp
enough to realise what she was doing. But there seemed to be genuine affection
between this boy and his youngest daughter. Amy was, he thought, if nothing
else, a pretty keen judge of character.</P>

<P>Helen had watched the interplay closely and she'd caught a whiff of
the details. But it was enough for their first meeting - time to end it.
&quot;We'd better go,&quot; she said and, taking Jake's hand, led him to
the door.</P>

<P>&quot;Uh - 'bye everyone,&quot; Jake said lamely as Helen dragged him
out.</P>

<P>&quot;Don't be too late!&quot; Maureen called as the door closed.</P>

<P>Arthur stood, staring at the door, thoughts and sensations cascading
through him.</P>

<P>&quot;It's okay, Dad. He's a good guy.&quot;</P>

<P>His gaze snapped onto Amy.</P>

<P>&quot;I mean it. He's not the sharpest knife in the drawer - Helen's
gonna to have to look after <I>him</I> most likely - but he's...&quot;
she sighed. &quot;...genuine. Isn't he, Rita?&quot;</P>

<P>Rita opened her mouth ready to launch a string of invective when she
saw Amy slowly turn towards her with an expression that said <I>one wrong
word and your ass is mine.</I></P>

<P>&quot;Yeah,&quot; she mumbled.</P>

<P>&quot;What? I didn't hear you,&quot; said Amy.</P>

<P>&quot;He's nice,&quot; Rita said, and she spun on her heel and walked
off.</P>

<P>

<P>Amanda and Vincent stood in the queue outside the chapel behind an older
couple who were restless, excited by the prospect of their pending nuptials.
A few of their friends were waiting with them, joking and laughing. In
a few minutes the previous customers were shot out of the production line
and Luke and Norma Jo (as their friends had called them) went in for their
turn. Vincent held Wind over his shoulder and he and Amanda smiled nervously
at each other, exchanging the odd word. both feeling a little strange.</P>

<P>&quot;I hope your friends turn up,&quot; he said.</P>

<P>&quot;They will.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I wonder what happens if they don't?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I don't know. I guess we lose our money and have to come back.
Don't worry. They'll be here. Oh - that reminds me - give me two tens,
please.&quot;</P>

<P>But Amanda's friends hadn't arrived when their names were called, and
they walked into the chapel as Luke and Norma Jo and their friends came
out, talking and laughing.</P>

<P>&quot;Witnesses?&quot; asked a bored-looking middle aged woman.</P>

<P>&quot;They're coming,&quot; said Amanda, hoping that they were.</P>

<P>&quot;Orright then, honey, go on down the front. I'll set 'm down when
they arrive.&quot;</P>

<P>They walked up to a low platform on which a short, dapper man in a blue
suit and gold-rimmed spectacles stood, smiling at them.</P>

<P>&quot;Howdy there,&quot; he looked down at the book in his hand, &quot;Vincent
and Amanda. I'm Thomas J Lindquist, licensed by the state o' Nevada to
solemnise weddin's and perform funerals. My guess is that you folks ain't
here for the funeral today?&quot;</P>

<P>Amanda laughed nervously at his stock joke, and smiled.</P>

<P>&quot;You got witnesses, folks, 'cause if y' ain't you're gonna have
to...&quot; He stopped and looked past them, his eyes wide.</P>

<P>Amanda turned to see Dino and Sam smile at her and wave, saying something
to the woman who'd met them at the door. Amanda interpreted Mr Lindquist's
expression as surprise that one of their witnesses was a black man, and
a wave of anger passed over her. &quot;Give him to me,&quot; she said to
Vincent, taking Wind from him and turning to Dino and Sam, who had sat
down in the front row. She handed Wind to Sam. &quot;Thanks,&quot; she
said, smiling gratefully at them.</P>

<P>Sam took Wind and grinned at her. &quot;Mazel tov, Amanda.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Congratulations, honey,&quot; said Dino. &quot;You'd better get
back. I think Vincent's getting nervous.&quot;</P>

<P>She grinned back and turned to see Vincent and Mr Lindquist staring
open-mouthed, and she shot them both a quick scowl as she turned to rejoin
Vincent.</P>

<P>Thomas J Lindquist cleared his throat and Vincent turned back to the
front.</P>

<P>&quot;Vincent Lane and Amanda Phillips,&quot; he started, glancing past
them again. &quot;The documents you have provided to this office of the
Nevada Marriage Bureau state that you are both of eighteen years of age
or older, that you are of sound mind, and that that there is no other impediment
to your marriage. The state of Nevada recognises marriage as the commitment
of a man and a woman to each other in a commited relationship...&quot;</P>

<P>Amanda heard a sniffle from behind her, and Sam's voice saying &quot;So
moving.&quot; She clenched her jaw trying to stifle a laugh.</P>

<P>&quot;...for life. And so I must ask you...&quot; he looked down at
his sheet again &quot;...Vincent, do you take Amanda to be your wife in
compliance with the laws of the state of Nevada and the regulations and
requirements of the Nevada Marriage Bureau?&quot;</P>

<P><I>Sniff</I></P>

<P>&quot;I do.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;And do you, Amanda, take Vincent to be your husband also in accordance
with the laws of the state of Nevada and the regulations and requirements
of the Nevada Marriage Bureau?&quot;</P>

<P><I>Sniff...oof</I></P>

<P>Amanda glanced behind her to see Dino withdraw the elbow that he'd used
to poke Sam in the ribs, and her eyes sparkled as she turned back to Mr
Lindquist. &quot;I...do.&quot; She clamped her jaw again and tried to look
serious as Wind gurgled happily in Sam's lap.</P>

<P>&quot;Then by the powers vested in me by the Governor of the state of
Nevada, it is my honour to declare you both man and wife. Congratulations.
Here is your commemorative certificate which you and your...witnesses...&quot;
he cast another glance towards Dino and Sam, &quot;...must sign before
you leave this chapel in order for your wedding to be officially recorded.&quot;
He handed Vincent a rolled piece of paper tied with a red ribbon, and Amanda
turned, half grinning and half laughing, and kissed Vincent deeply.</P>

<P>&quot;Miss Smyth,&quot; said Mr Lindquist, &quot;I'm taking a short
break.&quot; he said, pulling a handkerchief out of his pocket to mop his
forehead and walking off through a door behind in the back wall.</P>

<P>&quot;Congratulations, Vincent!&quot; Sam grabbed Vincent's hand and
pumped it as they unclinched, then turned to Amanda, holding Wind out to
her, and said &quot;I'd like to present you with this fine bouncing baby
boy, a gift of the State of Nevada and the Nevada Marriage Bureau, as a
souvenir of this wonderful day.&quot;</P>

<P>Amanda burst out laughing as she took Wind, while Vincent stared in
disbelief.</P>

<P>&quot;Told you,&quot; added Dino. &quot;Can't take him anywhere. Congratulations,
Vincent, you're a lucky man.&quot; He shook Vincent's hand and turned to
Amanda. &quot;I'm sorry about my Jewish buddy here,&quot; he said, &quot;I
hope he didn't bother you.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Bother me?&quot; Amanda laughed, shaking her head. &quot;You turned
it into something to remember. Thank you both!&quot; She said, kissing
Dino and Sam on the cheek. &quot;Oh, that reminds me...&quot; She reached
into her sleeve and pulled out the two tens that Vincent had given her
and handed one to each of them, to Vincent's amazed stare.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, you didn't have to do that,&quot; said Sam, hurriedly stuffing
the bill into his pocket. &quot;But since you offered...&quot;</P>

<P>Dino smiled. &quot;Thank you very much. Now - let's sign that certificate
and get out of here - Miss Smyth's anxious to get the next ceremony underway.&quot;
He took the paper from Vincent and walked back to the table that was set
up by the entry with a cheap ballpoint pen on a string. He signed and passed
the certificate to Sam. Vincent signed next, gurgling incoherently and
handing the pen to Amanda.</P>

<P>&quot;Well good luck, folks. I hope we'll see you again before you leave.
And thanks again for the privilege,&quot; said Dino, and he and Sam walked
off towards the bar.</P>

<P>Amanda took Vincent's hand and led him over to the elevator. &quot;How
could you?&quot; she said, sounding faintly annoyed. &quot;They were such
nice people!&quot;</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="25%"></P>

<P>They drove towards the high school in contemplative silence, Jake still
reeling from his 'interview' with Mr Barksdale and Helen worried over how
well it had gone. She drove, her mint-green heels on the seat beside her,
worrying about the future. She'd come to care deeply for jake, something
she neither expected nor wanted...or did she? She had plans and he probably
did too. Even now she wasn't sure she could bring herself to do what she
knew she needed to. Could she really break things off? Did she want to?
It would be easier on both of them if it was done sooner rather than later.
</P>

<P>Just then something white flashed towards the road and suddenly there
was a doe, frozen dead-centre in her headlights. She pumped the brakes
and threw the wheel to the left, managing to avoid the stunned creature,
but before she could swerve back onto the road the car's wheels slipped
off into the muddy embankment. She stopped the car, sitting there shaking
for a moment or two, her heart thudding over the words she knew Jake was
speaking, drowning them out. </P>

<P>Slowly the sounds of the world came back and she heard the car's motor
roaring and the noise of a wheel spinning in the mud. Jake leaned across
her and turned off the ignition. The roaring stopped and everything went
quiet. She turned to look at him, her eyes as wide as the doe's, and opened
her mouth to speak - but all that came out was a low wail and, to her horror,
she burst into tears.</P>

<P>Jake slid over and put his arms around her, holding her tight while
the shock worked its way out in sobs. </P>

<P>Eventually she calmed down and was able to look at him and speak. &quot;Oh
God - I'm sorry!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It's okay,&quot; he said soothingly. &quot;We're alright, that's
the important thing. I'll get out and see what's happened.&quot;</P>

<P>He pushed the door handle down and the door and it fell open. The car
was on a tilt of about twenty degrees and he climbed out carefully to avoid
slipping further down the embankment. &quot;Is there a flashlight in the
glove compartment?&quot; he asked, and Helen slid over to the passenger
side to open the door.</P>

<P>&quot;No. Damn. Hold on - there's a box of matches - will that do?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah - it's better then nothing. It's really dark.&quot; He reached
in and took the matchbox from her and struck one. By its flickering light
he could see that the rear wheel had dug itself into the mud up the axle.
The front wheel was... &quot;Ow! Dammit!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Are you okay?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah. I just let the match burn down too far.&quot;</P>

<P>He struck another and carefully made his way around to the front of
the car, steadying himself against the slippery mud. A third match showed
the the passenger side wheel was only an inch or so deep in the mud, not
that that helped. Making his way around to the driver's side he could see
that everything was okay, but the rear wheel was only just touching the
ground.</P>

<P>&quot;I don't know,&quot; he said to Helen, who'd wound down the window.
&quot;The back wheel's really dug in. We'll have to try to get it out.
I'll get behind and push. You start the motor and, when I say go, drop
it into low and accelerate slowly.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Okay,&quot; said Helen, starting the motor.</P>

<P>Jake walked round to the back of the car, realising in order for it
to work he'd have to lift nearly two tons of steel a foot off the ground
and push it up a twenty degree slope. But, as it so often does, masculine
pride overcame common sense and he bent down, gripping the bumper bar and
leaning into the&nbsp;back&nbsp;of the car to&nbsp;get&nbsp;maximum purchase.</P>

<P>&quot;Okay - put it into drive and slowly give it some gas.&quot;</P>

<P>The transmission clunked as the gears engaged. The motor slowly picked
up speed and the car inched forward so, for a second, Jake thought that
it was actually going to work. It didn't, of course. As the differential
fed power to the wheels the one with least resistance took it all and it
started to spin, flinging up a fine spray of pale brown mud.</P>

<P>&quot;TURN IT OFF!&quot; Jake yelled, letting go of the bumper bar and
standing up. &quot;Goddamncrapydamnpieceofdamncrap...&quot; he muttered
as he walked back round to the driver's window.</P>

<P>&quot;I guess it didn't work,&quot; Helen asked, not realising that
Jake had been spray-painted since his pants were hidden by the door.</P>

<P>&quot;You could put it that way,&quot; Jake grumbled. &quot;Not that
it'd make any difference now. I couldn't go like this.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Helen asked. Jake stepped back.</P>

<P>Helen groaned. The prom was a lost cause now. Even if they could get
the car back on the road Jake was right. But it wasn't the prospect of
missing the prom that bothered her. She knew that the prom was supposed
to be important. All the kids - all the girls anyway - had been talking
about if for six months as if it was the most important thing in their
lives. It probably was, Helen had gone with the flow, but it hadn't...<I>moved</I>
her, she hadn't shared their excitement. She hadn't been able to <I>feel</I>
it the way they did. The dress, the hair, the shoes - it had been all they'd
talked about. But while they'd spent their weekends planning things down
to the shade of eyeliner, Helen had been going to anti-war rallies. When
they'd asked her what she was going to wear she'd had to say that she didn't
know. If she'd been honest with herself she'd have added that she didn't
really care. Everything had been a last minute rush, and she'd only just
managed to pick up the dress in time. She'd had other things on her mind.
There had been times when she'd wanted to ask them what the big deal was,
when there was so much going on, when they were about to gain their freedom,
all they could think about was the prom? But it should have mattered to
her, she knew.</P>

<P>Only once, for a brief second or two, had she felt a flicker of understanding...when
Jake had turned and looked at her tonight and she'd seen that look on his
face...</P>

<P>She sighed inwardly.</P>

<P>In those rare moments when Helen had imagined her first boyfriend he
hadn't been anything like Jake. Not that she'd thought about it for a few
years. <I>And speaking of things not turning out the way you'd imagined</I>,
she thought, <I>there was the stunt driver</I>. <I>I wonder what his name
was? </I>If there'd been anything good about that little episode it was
that, sometimes, she smiled sardonically at the thought of how Rita would
react if she'd known. Rita. Rita was probably all bluster, her quasi-sexual
exploits just her way of making sure that there'd be <I>something</I> she
was better at than her older sister. <I>Something</I> she'd be more knowledgeable
about than her younger sister. Rita was probably still a virgin but she
made so much capital out of pointing out to Helen that <I>she</I> was.
Helen smiled at the thought of how Rita would react if she knew...</P>

<P>And she remembered Jake looking at her like <I>that</I> again.</P>

<P><I>There are three kinds of people</I>, she remembered hearing, <I>people
who make things happen, people who watch things happen, and people who
wonder what happened.</I> Jake was somewhere between the second and third,
she thought. Even when he'd flattened Kowalski, it had been, almost, as
if it hadn't quite been Jake, as if something else had taken over, leaving
Jake firmly planted in the third camp, standing there staring at Kowalski
with an expression that said &quot;whoa -what happened?&quot;</P>

<P>But he'd done it, and she'd...liked him for it.</P>

<P>The thing about Jake was that he was...real. There was nothing hidden
about him. He seemed...nice...sweet...because that was what he <I>was</I>.
And now he was going to feel dreadful because...and if she did what she
knew she had to do she was going to feel dreadful too. <I>If it were done
when tis done, then twere well it were done quickly</I>, she thought,
remembering the essay she'd written on Macbeth six months ago, and she
made up her mind.</P>

<P>She opened the car door and stepped out.</P>

<P>&quot;No!&quot; he yelled, &quot;It's mud...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Give me the matches. I want to see.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Helen - get back in the car!&nbsp;Please...&quot;</P>

<P>She snatched the matches from his hand, ignoring the gluggy feeling
of the mud between her toes, and lit one. Jake saw her look sadly at the
ruin that was his pants. He felt terrrible that her big night was ruined
and he tried to think of something comforting to say, but she immediately
turned toward the back of the car, dropping the spent match onto the ground.</P>

<P>&quot;Where are we stuck?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;On the other side, but I&nbsp;wouldn't try to...&quot; He groaned
as she made her way along the side of the car, steadying herself with one
hand as she slooshed and glugged her way through the slippery mud. At the
back of the car she turned down the slope of the embankment and Jake hurried
towards her, yelling &quot;Stop! Helen it's...&quot;</P>

<P>As Helen turned downslope and lost the prop of the car to lean against
she started slipping. Jake heard a quiet &quot;eep&quot; as he saw her
turn momentarily towards him, a look of helplessness in her eyes, and he
stood rooted to the spot as she built up speed and, inevitably, lost her
balance. She sat down and slid down the short slope to the bottom of the
embankment like a child on a toboggan. At the bottom she stopped, motionless,
and as Jake carefully glopped his way to the back of the car she turned,
just in time to see him lose his footing and follow her, sliding to the
bottom where he sat beside her, mud piled up in front of him.</P>

<P>Like Helen, he sat motionless for a couple of seconds and, as the unpleasant
wetness seeped through his clothes, an involuntary sound somewhere between
a grunt and squeak escaped as he looked down at his legs. Slowly he turned
towards Helen, his glance passing over her stockinged legs as the dress,
colourless in the pale light of a crescent moon, had ridden up around her
calves as she'd slid down the slope, to see her looking at him. Their eyes
locked, and, slowly, the corners of their mouths turned up and they burst
out laughing.</P>

<P>Jake stood up, the mud sucking at his legs, and reached out his hands
to Helen. She took them and, as she stood, looked down at the sorry mess
and tried to smoothed the fabric, only succeeding in wiping smears of mud
down it.</P>

<P>Remembering the pale green vision that he'd seen standing in front of
him half an hour ago, Jake's heart sank, and he said &quot;I'm...really
sorry, Helen.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It's not your fault, Jake,&quot; she said softly and, holding
each other's hands for balance, they started climbing the few slippery
steps back up to where the car lay like a wounded animal.</P>

<P>&quot;I'll see if I can get someone to stop and help,&quot; he said.
&quot;There's some traffic.&quot; He opened the car door for Helen to get
in, but she put her hand against it, stopping him.</P>

<P>&quot;I don't want to get in - we should let it dry and try to brush
it off.&quot; She paused. &quot;And, besides...um, maybe we could just
spend some time...talking.&quot;</P>

<P>Jake was puzzled. What was there to talk about? But the prospect of
spending time with Helen, just the two of them, alone, on a warm, dark,
mid-Spring night, was an attractive proposition. &quot;Uh, sure. We could,
um, sit on the trunk I guess. We'll have to wash it anyway.&quot;</P>

<P>Helen smiled agreement and they edged round to the back of the car.
Jake lifted Helen up onto the trunk then turned round and levered himself
up to sit beside her. For a minute or two they just sat, Jake waiting for
Helen to start and she not sure how to.</P>

<P>&quot;What have you got planned for the vacation? And next year,&quot;
she asked finally.</P>

<P>Jake thought for a minute. &quot;I don't know,&quot; he sighed. &quot;I
can't believe that it's graduation and I&nbsp;haven't even thought about
it. I was worried about getting drafted, but...I'm the last male in my
family so they won't draft me.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Ah,&quot; Helen answered non-committaly. &quot;That's good.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</P>

<P>Another minute passed awkwardly. Jake mightn't have been the most perceptive
of people but he could see where this was going, and he braced himself
as he asked the inevitable question. &quot;How about you?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I wasn't sure until a week ago. Now I know.&quot;</P>

<P>Jake looked round at her. &quot;Oh. What...?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I'm still hoping to get into Berkeley, but I'm going to take a
year off first.&quot;</P>

<P>Jake hadn't expected that. &quot;What, um, happened to make you decide
to do that?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I got a letter from a friend.&quot;</P>

<P>Jake's heart sank. &quot;Oh. What did he say?&quot;</P>

<P><I>Damn, this is hurting him already. </I>&quot;She.&quot; </P>

<P>&quot;Ah.&quot; The pain eased a little.</P>

<P>Helen paused. &quot;It was...it...opened my eyes.&quot; She turned to
him. &quot;Sorry - I mean it made me realise that there are things I want
to...experience...before I commit to more study.&quot; She stared straight
ahead, her eyes unfocussed. &quot;Her name's Anne. She used to live down
the road from me when we were kids. She's a few years older than me, but
we were good friends. We still are. She took up with a guy when she was
a high school senior and when she graduated they hit the road. She writes
every now and then.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Uh huh,&quot; said Jake.</P>

<P>&quot;She lives in San Francisco now,&quot; Helen continued. &quot;She's
really into the hippie thing, but they do a lot of travelling around, anti-Viet
Nam rallies, that sort of thing, but mainly just to see America.&quot;</P>

<P>Helen's voice was wistful, and Jake found himself thinking how nice
it would be...</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah. Anyway, they went camping with some friends.&quot; She turned,
suddenly, to Jake. &quot;Have you ever seen a birth? I mean - did you have
cats or anything?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Cats? No.&quot; A look of anger appeared on Jake's face. &quot;I
always wanted a cat. But Dad'd never let me have one! 'Only girls have
cats!' he said. Jakey could never have cats. Oh no. It was dogs or nothing
as far as Mad Dog was...!&quot; He turned to see Helen staring at him with
wide eyes. &quot;I just wanted...a cat...&quot; he tailed off.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh. Well, anyway, the girl they went with was pregnant, and she
wasn't supposed to have the baby for another week, but it decided to come
early. They couldn't get out - the storm blew a tree down across the only
road out.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Wow. What did they do?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The only thing they could. Anne had to deliver the baby.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Was it alright?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes.&quot; She paused. &quot;You should have seen how she wrote
about it, Jake.&quot; She was speaking quietly, almost whispering. &quot;It
just...it was like I was there. It made me shiver. The way she described
how it felt when the baby came out and she held it.&quot;</P>

<P>Jake found himself lost in the vision, suddenly beginning to sense the
possibilities again, and he breathed a sighed &quot;Wow!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;They weren't married. The mother and father I mean. Kyle - that's
Anne's guy - her 'old man' she calls him,&quot; she said, smiling. &quot;His
name's Kyle Owen Thomas Yeager - everyone's called him 'Coyote' since he
was a little kid...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Coyo...oh yeah! His initials!&quot; Jake said.</P>

<P>&quot;Uh huh. Anyway, Coyote 'married' them while the baby was being
born. The way she told the story, Jake - it made me cry.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;They're just a couple of years older than us, right?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That's right.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I understand.&quot;</P>

<P>Helen looked at him. He was looking straight ahead. She wasn't sure
how he was reacting. &quot;Yeah. Jake...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You're going away, aren't you?&quot;</P>

<P>Amanda put the key into the lock below the elevator buttons, her annoyance
level rising.</P>

<P>&quot;How...wha...?&quot; stuttered Vincent. &quot;What do you mean,
'how could I'?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I mean just because Sam was black was no reason to be so rude!
I didn't think that you cared about that sort of thing!'</P>

<P>&quot;Because he was...black...?&quot; he said. &quot;Do you have any
idea who they were?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I told you! Dino and Sam! They work here.&quot;</P>

<P>The elevator arrived and they stepped out.</P>

<P>&quot;You really don't know who they were, do you?&quot; he said, incredulous.
&quot;You have no idea!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What does it matter?&quot; she asked, a note of annoyance in her
voice as she lay Wind on the bed. &quot;Look - they signed the certificate.
Show me!&quot;</P>

<P>He handed the rolled-up certificate to her and she slipped the ribbon
off and unrolled it. While she looked for their signature, Vincent noticed
an envelope propped up on the counter, with 'Mr. and Mrs. Lane' scrawled
across the front. He opened it and pulled out a trio of tickets, just as
Amanda found what she was looking for. </P>

<P>Her face went pale. </P>

<P>&quot;Oh my God...&quot; she breathed, sitting down heavily and letting
the certificate fall to the floor. </P>
