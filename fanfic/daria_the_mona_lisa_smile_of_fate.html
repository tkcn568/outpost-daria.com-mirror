THE MONA LISA SMILE OF FATE<br>
by CDM (cdm2012@ntin.net)<br>
<P>
[EXT Gupty house. BGM The Cure's "Fascination Street"]
<P>
[INT Tad and Tricia's room, BGM fading. Tad and Tricia are tucked in,
Daria and Jane finishing the lesson for the night]
<P>
JANE: (cont.) -- and that's why you should never eat Twinkies.
<P>
TAD &amp; TRICIA: Eww...
<P>
DARIA: And now that the mind warping is complete, what was the false
fact?
<P>
TRICIA: That the government's training pets to spy on their owners?
<P>
JANE: Close, but no candy cigar.
<P>
DARIA: If you had been watching Sick Sad World you'd know better than
to trust Mr. Fuzzy-Wuzzy.
<P>
TRICIA: No fair! Mom and Dad bought a TV with the latest V-Chip!
<P>
TAD: Uhm... there was no false fact?
<P>
DARIA: Correct. If there was a set curriculum, that would make me a
teacher and my life would be over.
<P>
TAD: Yes! In your face, Tricia!
<P>
TRICIA: That was my original answer!
<P>
JANE: (to Daria) I still can't believe you were asked back after the last
time.
<P>
DARIA: As has often been my experience, I was the last resort.
<P>
TAD: We did everything you said! Last week we asked the elderly woman
who was sitting us if she babysat for Moses!
<P>
DARIA: Only after she proved to be a pain in the butt, I hope?
<P>
TRICIA: We didn't want to be mean, but she kept calling us Bobby and
Cindy!
<P>
TAD: And she thought Tricia's skirt was too short!
<P>
JANE: (to Daria) You should get this woman to sit Quinn sometime.
<P>
DARIA: I've seen enough death and destruction to last a lifetime. I guess
that's it for tonight -
<P>
TAD: What about our story?
<P>
DARIA: I don't know, we're running pretty late...
<P>
TRICIA: But mom and dad are holding couple's therapy at your house
again!
<P>
DARIA: Good point. I've seen my father's "daddy's medicine" binges one
too many times.
<P>
TAD: Come on, Daria!
<P>
JANE: Yeah, come on, Daria!
<P>
DARIA: Okay, how about "The Tortoise and the Hare"?
<P>
TAD: We want a new story!
<P>
TRICIA: Jane says you're a good writer!
<P>
DARIA: Sure you wouldn't rather hear "The Fiddly Ferret and the Uppity
Unicorn" again? I'll even do the funny voices.
<P>
JANE: That would require actual expression. How about a family vacation
story, like the one you started telling me at lunch before Ms. Li threw a
surprise sniper drill?
<P>
DARIA: (uneasily) I don't know, it gets rough in some sections...
<P>
TAD: But you read us the version of "The Ugly Duckling" where he goes
on a killing spree!
<P>
[A beat as Daria sighs]
<P>
DARIA: I bear no responsibility for any mental trauma incurred from the
following story, or contact with me in general. (beat) It was the summer
of 1991 and my family was on the road trip from Hell, aka Highland, to
visit my aunt in El Paso...
<P>
[The screen goes wobbly as we cut to the next scene]
<P>
[INT Morgendorffer Mini-Van, BGM The Talking Heads "Road To
Nowhere".
<P>
Daria and Quinn, ten and nine years old respectively, are dressed in the
same manner as in "Camp Fear". Jake and Helen are in their casual
wear. Quinn fidgets while Daria reads "The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the
Galaxy". Helen is looking at a map, folded out over her side of the
dashboard while Jake drives. BGM fades as Daria continues her
narration]
<P>
DARIA: (VO, cont.) As for the rest of the world, Jonathon Brandis was
setting the hearts of girls across the country aflutter, Vanilla Ice paved
the way for Eminem, and *almost* every kid in town owned a Nintendo.
<P>
JANE: (VO) Did Quinn need some more fashionable jams for the new
school year?
<P>
DARIA: (VO) We had one, but Jake suffered a nervous breakdown trying
to beat The Legend of Zelda and took a hammer to it.
<P>
HELEN: (in mid conversation) ...she said to go straight down I-95, then -
<P>
JAKE: (interrupting) Don't worry, Helen, I know Texas like the back of my
hand!
<P>
HELEN: I just don't want to be late! My sister is so busy that we rarely get
to see each other! (bitterly) She also finds a way to worm out of every
family gathering.
<P>
JAKE: (muttering) Wish I could skip out on seeing your mother...
<P>
QUINN: Mu-om, I have to go!
<P>
HELEN: For the last time, Quinn, if it's that bad, use the cup!
<P>
QUINN: (petulantly) I am *not* going in some cheap Tallsup's cup!
<P>
DARIA: (not looking up from her book) You could use one of those pretty
cacti.
<P>
HELEN: Daria...
<P>
JAKE: (unintentionally interrupting) Look at that beautiful West Texas
scenery! It just takes your breath away!
<P>
DARIA: (still reading) Yes, the way the sun glares off the horizon is
spellbinding.
<P>
JAKE: (cool voice) It's a good thing I bought these rad Ray-Bans, huh,
kiddo?
<P>
QUINN: I just read in Little Miss Waif that Blu-Blockers are more
fashionable, Daddy.
<P>
JAKE: (fretful) Really?
<P>
HELEN: Quinn, what have I told you about that magazine? Why don't you
read those Zoobooks we gave you?
<P>
QUINN: But the animals in it are so icky, and Daria keeps burying them!
<P>
HELEN: (shock) Daria, why would you do such a thing?!
<P>
DARIA: I think she meant "borrowing", Mom.
<P>
HELEN: Oh.
<P>
[An awkward silence falls as Jake and Helen try to figure out a way to
carry on the conversation. Jake gives up quickly and starts whistling
"On The Road Again". A few bars in he tapers off, seeing Helen giving
him a dirty look. A beat later his expression brightens]
<P>
JAKE: Hey, why don't we have a family sing-along!
<P>
[Daria closes her book and bends down out of frame]
<P>
HELEN: That's a great idea! How about a round of "Row Row Your Boat"?
<P>
QUINN: Do we have to? Sing-alongs are so geeky!
<P>
JAKE: It'll be fun, pumpkin! I'll start!
<P>
HELEN: No, I will!
<P>
[Daria emerges wearing a pair of headphones and a satisfied smirk]
<P>
HELEN &amp; JAKE: o/~ Row row row your boat, gently down the stream, o/~
<P>
HELEN: No, Jake, it's a *row*!
<P>
JAKE: Oh, right!
<P>
[Quinn lets out an exasperated sigh]
<P>
HELEN: o/~ Row row row your boat, gently down the stream, o/~
<P>
JAKE: o/~ Merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream! o/~
<P>
HELEN: I don't think you understand what a row is, Ja-
<P>
[Suddenly the car swerves as a semi rushes past, causing Daria to buck
sideways and lose her headphones while Quinn bumps her head on the
window. Helen braces herself on the dashboard while Jake honks the
horn and waves his fist]
<P>
QUINN: OW! Gawd!
<P>
JAKE: Lousy truckers, think they own the road, WELL I GOT A DELIVERY
FOR YA, YA GOD-
<P>
HELEN: JAKE, SWEAR JAR! (turning back to check on Daria and Quinn)
Girls, are you okay?
<P>
DARIA: I have a ringing in my ears, but I might have had the volume too
high.
<P>
[Another moment of silence follows after Helen turns her attention back to
the road. They pass by a teenage couple necking in 60's roadster off the
side of the road]
<P>
QUINN: Who was that?
<P>
DARIA: That's Speed Racer. He's a demon on wheels.
<P>
QUINN: (snide) I wasn't talking to you. (normal) Mom, Dad, what were
they doing?
<P>
JAKE: (hesitantly) Uhm...
<P>
HELEN: (slowly) Well... you see, it's kind of like...
<P>
JAKE: (quickly) Hey, why don't we listen to the radio?
<P>
HELEN: (relieved) Yes, let's!
<P>
[Jake clicks the radio on, fiddling with the tuning for a few seconds before
settling on a station]
<P>
DJ #1: All the signs point towards the End Times, my friends!
<P>
[Jake quickly twists the tuning knob]
<P>
DJ #2: (robotic voice) Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall
see him, and they also which pierced him, and all kindred's of the earth
shall wail because of him.
<P>
DARIA: Is that the new Auto DJ 5000 I've heard so much about?
<P>
HELEN: (mild annoyance) It might help if you had it on FM.
<P>
JAKE: Good idea!
<P>
[He flips the band button and turns the knob again]
<P>
DJ #3: And next in our countdown, Michael Bolton!
<P>
HELEN: Oh, never mind!
<P>
[She snaps it off. After a brief silence Jake's expression brightens]
<P>
JAKE: Hey, I just remembered something!
<P>
DARIA: (to herself) Please tell me we left the backdoor unlocked.
<P>
[He does a hard right turn down a dirt road]
<P>
HELEN: Jake, stick to the route Amy told us!
<P>
JAKE: Don't worry, I know a shortcut!
<P>
HELEN: Do you remember the last time we took one of your shortcuts?
<P>
JAKE: I swear, those guys at the bait shop didn't mention anything about
open sewers!
<P>
[Time lapse - it's now dusk outside. Daria is straining to read, Quinn is
asleep, and Helen is arguing with Jake]
<P>
HELEN: Jake, do you have any clue where we're going?
<P>
JAKE: I swear, honey, that sign back there said El Paso fifty miles!
<P>
[In the backseat Quinn wakes up, stretching and yawning]
<P>
HELEN: Why don't we go back and ask those cops we saw?
<P>
JAKE: The sign pointed this way! Admit I'm right, admit I'm right!
<P>
JANE: (VO) So your parents argued and you supplied the color
commentary. Quite riveting!
<P>
DARIA: (VO) Shush, you.
<P>
HELEN: I swear, every trip you come up with some way... [her attention is
distracted by something off screen] Wait, look over there!
<P>
[A panning shot of what Helen spotted. It's a small, drab cottage with a
serial killer vibe. Cut back to the family]
<P>
QUINN: Ugh, who decorated that place, Beavis and Butthead?
<P>
JAKE: I don't know, their place looked okay! I just wish I could
remember when I saw it...
<P>
DARIA: It was when you tried to complain to their parents about the firecrackers they left in our mailbox.
<P>
HELEN: (muttering) Lousy punks... (aloud) Why don't we pull over and ask
for directions?
<P>
JAKE: I can find the way back!
<P>
HELEN: Allow me to rephrase that. *Stop* and ask for directions or we
take the bus next time.
<P>
QUINN: The bus?! But we always get stuck to the stinky guy!
<P>
DARIA: At least they have a bathroom.
<P>
JAKE: Okay, fine! I'll stop, but only to please you!
<P>
[Quick shot of the car parking in the driveway, then back to the family.
They stare at the off-screen house]
<P>
DARIA: Quinn should lead so she can absorb the first hail of bullets.
<P>
QUINN: Hey!
<P>
HELEN: Daria!
<P>
JAKE: Somebody just came out!
<P>
[A man exits through the front door onto the porch. His grimy face is
covered by an unkempt beard. Atop his head is a weather-beaten beige
hat. Wearing a gray jacket over a brown shirt, his dingy pants, also
beige, are stretched to breaking point over his massive thighs. He seems
to be on the verge of tipping over, balancing himself with a wrought iron
staff, the end fashioned into a hand. His face is in a constant state of tic.
His oddest feature, though, are cloven hooves where his feet should be]
<P>
QUINN: Eew! What's wrong with his feet, Daddy?
<P>
JAKE: What do you mean - (a beat as he sees what Quinn's talking about)
Hey, he's got hooves for feet! Neat!
<P>
DARIA: I wonder if Doctor Scholl's makes something for that.
<P>
HELEN: Quinn, Jake, Daria! You shouldn't make light of other people's
disfigurements!
<P>
JAKE: Why don't ask him for directions?
<P>
HELEN: I don't know...
<P>
JAKE: Come on, what could possibly go wrong?
<P>
JANE: (VO) In case you didn't know, kids, that's where you go "Dunh dunh
dunh!"
<P>
TAD &amp; TRICIA: (VO, awkwardly) Dunh dunh dunh?
<P>
DARIA: (VO) Precisely.
<P>
HELEN: I guess it wouldn't hurt to find out where the nearest motel is.
We'll never make it to Amy's tonight.
<P>
QUINN: Maybe he has a bathroom!
<P>
DARIA: A million scenarios are running through my head, all ending with
a posthumous appearance on Unsolved Mysteries.
<P>
JAKE: Right then, let's do it!
<P>
[They all exit the car]

<P>[EXT House, BGM "Torgo's Theme" by Robert Smith Jr., which continues
in the background as the scene progresses. The family walks up to within
a few steps of the porch, Helen and Jake in lead, the girls behind them]
<P>
TORGO: <I>I am ToRGo... I take CAre of the place while the MASter is
awaY... </I><P>
<P>
DARIA: His parents must be so proud.
<P>
JAKE: Hey there! I'm Jake, this is my wife Helen, and these are our daughters Daria and Quinn!
<P>
TORGO: <I>YoU cannot stay heRE... the MAstER doesn't like chilDRen. </I><P>
<P>
DARIA: I feel the same way about people who call themselves "the
Master".
<P>
HELEN: (laughing) Oh, we don't want to stay here, God no! We just need
directions to the nearest Best Western!
<P>
TORGO: <I>TheRE is no place like THat around heRE... </I><P>
<P>
HELEN: Could we at least come in to get a better look at our map?
<P>
TORGO: <I>I... don't knOW... the MastER... wouldn't apprOve... </I><P>
<P>
JAKE: Ah, I'm sure he won't mind! Come on Torgo, be a pal!
<P>
[Torgo considers this. A very lengthy beat follows]
<P>
JAKE: (whispering) Helen, should I poke him or something to make sure
he's still alive?
<P>
QUINN: (whispering) He doesn't smell like he's alive!
<P>
DARIA: (whispering) That's just the road kill from a few -
<P>
TORGO: (interrupting, answering) <I>I... gueSS so... </I><P>
<P>
[Torgo steps aside as Jake and Daria go in while Helen heads back to get
the map. Quinn walks up to Torgo]
<P>
QUINN: Uhm... sir, do you have a bathroom?
<P>
TORGO: <I>TheRe is nO place like thAT here... </I><P>
<P>
QUINN: Come *on*! If you let me use it I'll give you the subscription
number to J. Crew so you can find something better than those *things*
you're wearing!
<P>
[Helen walks by and into the house, a bundle of papers under her arm]
<P>
HELEN: Use a bush, Quinn!
<P>
QUINN: (petulantly) Never mind.
<P>
[She goes in, followed by Torgo]
<P>
[INT Living room, BGM continuing from previous scene. A ratty
couch, coffee table, and battered bookshelf in the corner are the only
distinguishing features. There are two doors, one leading off to a
bedroom and the other a kitchen. Helen has the map folded out over
the table, Quinn sitting next to her. Torgo is leaning on the bedroom
doorframe while Jake stares at something off screen. Daria stands
near the front door, taking in the ambience]
<P>
DARIA: The Leatherface residence, I feel better already. (beat) Where
is that music coming from?
<P>
[Daria walks over to Torgo and sees a phonograph in the bedroom, the
source of the BGM]
<P>
DARIA: Could you please turn that off?
<P>
TORGO: <I>NO problEM... </I><P>
<P>
[He starts to wobble over to the radio. After a very slow beat Daria
grows impatient and out walks Torgo, switching it off herself. She turns
back to him]
<P>
DARIA: Nice staff. How much for it?
<P>
TORGO: <I>The MAster does not belIEVE in money... </I><P>
<P>
DARIA: What if I traded you Quinn for it?
<P>
HELEN: (OS) Daria, stop pestering Torgo!
<P>
[Daria walks back into the living room. Jake is motioning for Helen's
attention as she enters]
<P>
JAKE: Honey, look at this!
<P>
HELEN: Jake, I'm trying to find some way out of this mess!
<P>
JAKE: But it's really neat!
<P>
[Helen lets loose an exasperated sigh and walks over to where Jake is.
He's staring at a framed velvet painting of a thin, pale man with a thick
black mustache and a mop of black hair, wearing a black &amp; red robe,
next to him a demonic looking Doberman, hanging above a scorched
fireplace. Daria joins them.]
<P>
JANE: (VO) Anyone who owns a velvet painting has to be on the side of
evil.
<P>
DARIA: (VO) Or an Elvis fan.
<P>
TAD: (VO) Our parents have a velvet painting of Pat Boone in their
bedroom! It's really neat!
<P>
JANE: (VO) I rest my case.
<P>
JAKE: That must be the Master!
<P>
HELEN: Ooh, gives me chills looking at him and that beast!
<P>
JAKE: Yeah, I'd sure hate to run up on it at night!
<P>
DARIA: If we do we'll just throw Quinn to it.
<P>
QUINN: (OS) Hey!
<P>
HELEN: Daria, I wish you'd stop those inappropriate comments.
<P>
DARIA: If you have a better idea for entertaining myself, I'm game.
<P>
JAKE: Why don't you go look at those books over in the corner, kiddo?
<P>
DARIA: Maybe there's a book with an amnesia spell so I can forget the
last six hours, or years.
<P>
[Daria goes over to the bookcase as Torgo walks up to Jake and Helen]
<P>
HELEN: Where is this Master of yours anyways?
<P>
TORGO: <I>He is nOT in this world but HE is with us ALways, wherever we
go, he is with us. </I><P>
<P>
JAKE: That's too bad. I bet me and him'd get along well!
<P>
HELEN: I hate to be a bother, but do you have a phone we could use?
<P>
TORGO: <I>We dOn't hAve that device... the MAster doesn't BElieve in
them.
</I><P>
HELEN: Really? How... *weird*.
<P>
JAKE: (whispering) They probably couldn't pay the phone bill! (aloud) No
biggie, my man, happens to everyone! Rough times, rough times...
<P>
HELEN: (sighing) We'll just try to find the highway, (darkly) hopefully
before we cross into Mexico... (normal) Jake, why don't you start the
car while I give the map another look? This place is giving me the creeps!
<P>
JAKE: Honey, you're embarrassing Torgo!
<P>
TORGO: <I>You hAve nothing to fEAR, Madam... the MastER likes you. He
LIkes beaUtiful womEN... </I><P>
<P>
HELEN: (flattered) Well, I try to take care of myself... (the words sink in)
EXCUSE ME?! What's that supposed to mean?!
<P>
JAKE: He was just trying to compliment you, dear! Now stay here and I'll
have the car roaring in no time!
<P>
[As Jake leaves and Helen returns to the couch, we pan across to Daria,
looking through the book shelf]
<P>
DARIA: (reading off the book spines) Tobin's Spirit Guide... signed copy
of the Necronomicon... and the collected Bearinstein Bears. Nothing
wrong here.
<P>
[Pan back over to the couch]
<P>
QUINN: Mom, can we leave now? This place smells!
<P>
HELEN: We'll be out of here as soon as -
<P>
JAKE: (OS) Lousy piece of junk, START, DAMN YOU, START!
<P>
HELEN: (standing, wearily) Stay here, girls, I need to talk to your father...
(mumbling as she walks off) ...about trial separation.
<P>
[EXT House. Helen, her arms folded, walks over to the driver's side of
the van. Jake is hitting the steering wheel as he grinds the ignition]
<P>
JAKE: Lousy piece of junk, no wonder they say Fixed Or Repaired - (he
notices Helen) Hey, honey! Wouldn't ya know it, the car's having a
teensy problem, but I can fix it!
<P>
HELEN: (exasperated) I thought you had it tuned up before we left?
<P>
JAKE: I did, I swear! Or maybe it was the Le Baron I took... give me an
hour and I'll have it running like new! Mad Dog Morgendorffer didn't raise
little Jakey to be a car klutz! (mumbling) He made sure of that...
<P>
[Helen shakes her head and walks off. Jake gets out and follows]
<P>
[INT House. Quinn plays with a toy make-up kit while Daria examines the
painting. Helen sits down, Jake trailing behind]
<P>
JAKE: I'll take care of everything, honey! Why don't you find Torgo and
talk to him for awhile?
<P>
HELEN: (crossing her arms) Absolutely not! Something doesn't rub right
about him...
<P>
JAKE: It's just your imagination! Torgo's cool! (to Daria) Isn't he, Daria?
<P>
DARIA: (walking over to face her parents) Cool as black corduroys on
an August day.
<P>
[Jane, VO, bursts out laughing]
<P>
DARIA: (VO) What?
<P>
JANE: (VO, recovering) Sorry... I just imagined you saying that with a
Texas twang!
<P>
TRICIA: (VO) I heard they let you carry guns around in the open in
Texas!
<P>
DARIA: (VO) Not quite, but it's a good thing I don't have one now.
Anyway, I came to the most sensible conclusion possible...
<P>
DARIA: Why don't we just leave?
<P>
HELEN: (mild disgust) Your father can't get the car started.
<P>
JAKE: It isn't my fault! I mean yeah, the guy at Carzone talked me into
buying the store brand of spark plug, but he swore they were just as
good! Lousy salesmen, Shakespeare was right...
<P>
QUINN: (dropping her toy in horror) You mean we have to stay here?!
<P>
DARIA: We could walk. You always say you two need to get more
exercise.
<P>
QUINN: Walk? Out in the desert?! But I'll get all sweaty!
<P>
DARIA: (to Quinn) You don't have sweat glands yet.
<P>
HELEN: I suppose I could stay in the car with Quinn while you and your
father -
<P>
[The dark howl of a hound off-screen interrupts her, causing everyone to
jump]
<P>
JAKE: What was that?
<P>
DARIA: Probably a hell beast gathering virgins for the dark lord.
<P>
HELEN: Daria!
<P>
DARIA: Sorry, heck beast.
<P>
JAKE: Did you hear that, Helen? It's a hel- I mean heck beast!
<P>
[Jake and Helen rush out]
<P>
[EXT House. Jake and Helen step out on the porch. Night has fallen]
<P>
JAKE: (yelling) Look, I know you're a horrible hell beast, but it's after
nine and we've got kids!
<P>
HELEN: It's not a hell beast, Jake!
<P>
JAKE: Well it's a good thing I brought the gun, that way if there is
anything – (he turns to see Helen's enraged look, quietly) Oh poopie!
<P>
HELEN: (livid) You brought the gun?! After I specifically told you to get
rid of it? What if Daria or Quinn found it?
<P>
JAKE: They couldn't! I put it somewhere safe this time!
<P>
HELEN: I assume by "somewhere safe" you mean the glove
compartment?
<P>
JAKE: Well... yeah, but it's locked!
<P>
HELEN: (exasperated) Never mind, we'll talk about it later. I guess I can
use this time to go over some papers, but if Torgo tries anything I want
you on him with that gun in a heartbeat!
<P>
JAKE: Don't worry about a thing, dear! I'll have the car up and running
in no time! Now how about a good luck kiss?
<P>
[He puckers his lips and closes his eyes in expectation. Helen rolls her
eyes and walks back inside, slamming the screen door. Jake looks
perturbed, but quickly gets a determined look on his face]
<P>
JAKE: (shaking his fist) You'll be kissing me all over when we're in that
air-conditioned motel room!
<P>
[He strides purposefully off-screen]
<P>
[INT House. Quinn is asleep while Daria is reading "Blood-Curdling Tales
of Terror and the Macabre", an H.P. Lovecraft collection. Helen walks in
and over to Daria]
<P>
HELEN: Daria, could you watch your sister for a minute?
<P>
DARIA: (yawning, putting the book down) I don't know, I'm sort of beat
myself...
<P>
HELEN: No bribes. We need every penny since your father's business
slowed down.
<P>
DARIA: (picking the book up) Drats.
<P>
[Helen gathers the map and her papers, exiting into the bedroom. After
a moment Quinn awakes and starts fidgeting]
<P>
QUINN: Ooh... I've got to find a bathroom!
<P>
DARIA: Just go in the corner like Torgo did.
<P>
[Quinn gets up and rushes walking off-screen]
<P>
DARIA: Quinn, Mom and Dad don't want us to wander off.
<P>
QUINN: (calling back) *You* can wait here, but I'll burst if I don't do
something!
<P>
[She exits through the kitchen door]
<P>
DARIA: There's an image from my fondest dreams... Quinn, wait!
<P>
[Daria drops her book and follows]
<P>
[INT House, Bedroom. Helen is sitting on the bed, looking over some
briefs, while Torgo stares at her from the doorway]
<P>
HELEN: I'll be so glad once we leave this place! (beat, looking at Torgo)
Uhm, no offense.
<P>
TORGO: (stumbling towards her) <I>You don't HAve to GO... the mASTer
wants yoU... </I><P>
<P>
HELEN: What's that supposed to mean?
<P>
[Torgo stops within a few feet from her. He raises his arm, making a
very slow reach for Helen]
<P>
HELEN: Yes, can I help you?
<P>
[He grabs a hold of her shoulder and starts stroking it. Helen gasps in
shock, stands up, and cold cocks him, causing Torgo to topple to the
ground]
<P>
HELEN: YOU PERVERTED BEAST! JAKE! GET IN HERE THIS
MINUTE!
<P>
TORGO: <I>You leAD me on, yOU gave me mixed sIGnals... </I><P>
<P>
HELEN: I'll give you a mixed signal, you degenerate! After my husband
and I beat the snot out of you and we get out of this hellhole, I'll sue
those dingy rags off your back!
<P>
[Torgo stumbles up and runs away]
<P>
JANE: (VO) That was an appropriate scene for two eight year olds.
<P>
TAD: (VO) What was he trying to do? Why'd your mother get so mad?
<P>
DARIA: (VO, to Jane) Your point? (to Tad) It's what that guy with the red
hair and plastic dolls wanted to do to me at the parade the other week.
<P>
TAD: (VO) Oh! (beat) What was that?
<P>
JANE: (VO) You don't need to know that yet, or ever for that matter.
<P>
[INT House, Kitchen. As Daria flips the light on a multitude of roaches
scurry out of sight. Noticing a door to her right, she knocks on it]
<P>
DARIA: Quinn, are you in there? (a beat, smirking) I know where your
L.A. Darcy is, and I have Dad's lighter! (another beat) Drat.
<P>
[She opens the door and exits through it]
<P>
[EXT House. Jake is fiddling around under the van's hood]
<P>
JAKE: I wish that Master was here, I bet he could fix this!
<P>
[Helen, shaking with rage, storms over to the van]
<P>
HELEN: Jake, didn't you hear me pleading for help?!
<P>
JAKE: I'm trying to fix the car like you wanted! (cute voice) What could
be so bad you need Big Jakey's help?
<P>
HELEN: I need Big Jakey to kick the Little Torgo! That creep made a pass
at me!
<P>
JAKE: I'm sure... (beat) WHAT?! WHY THAT SON OF A -
<P>
[In his anger Jake darts up, hitting his head on the hood]
<P>
JAKE: OW! GAH DAMMIT!
<P>
HELEN: Well, what are you going to do?
<P>
JAKE: (rubbing his head) Find some aspirin... oh, you mean about Torgo!
(shaking his fist) Don't worry, I'll make him rue the day he touched Jake
Morgendorffer's wife!
<P>
[He storms back into the house, Helen following]
<P>
[EXT House. Daria comes out the backdoor into near-darkness]
<P>
DARIA: (yelling) Quinn! Are you out here? (normal) Why am I worried,
she'd be afraid of her skin drying out.
<P>
[She notices a light off in the distance, partially obscured by several
objects she can't discern]
<P>
DARIA: Likely scenario, it's a bonfire. Starting to get nervous scenario,
it's Torgo's altar to Yog-Sothoth.
<P>
JANE: (VO) I'll take what's behind curtain two, Wink.
<P>
DARIA: (VO) No, an Elder God would have better taste in servants.
<P>
TRICIA: (VO) Weren't you scared?
<P>
DARIA: (VO) A bit, but I couldn't leave Quinn alone in a place like that.
If I'd known Torgo leaned towards the octogenarian set, though, I'd be
telling a different story.
<P>
[Daria walks towards the circle, stopping a few feet away. We see a
small campfire surrounded by seven pillars. Just as many women are
leaning against each of them in what seems to be a deathlike trance.
Each are dressed in sheer robes. Off to her right is a stone slab
between two pillars. On it lies the Master, who seems to be dead]
<P>
DARIA: (backing up) Out of witty remarks. Extremely creeped out.
Sister's welfare being pushed aside in interest of self-preservation.
<P>
[She runs back to the house]

<P>[INT Living Room. Daria enters from the kitchen while Jake and
Helen, still steaming, come in]
<P>
JAKE: Daria! Have you seen Torgo?
<P>
DARIA: No, but there's a bunch of dead people in the backyard.
Quinn's missing, too.
<P>
HELEN: QUINN'S MISSING?!
<P>
JAKE: WITH THAT SICKO ON THE PREMISES?!
<P>
DARIA: Not to mention the people in the backyard.
<P>
JAKE: Maybe she's in one of the other rooms!
<P>
DARIA: The kitchen or the bedroom, so many choices. I do know
she's not outside *with those people I found.*
<P>
[Helen runs into the bedroom to check while Jake does so in the kitchen.
A moment later they return]
<P>
HELEN: Maybe she's outside!
<P>
DARIA: Yes, outside. With the *dead people*.
<P>
[Jake and Helen run out. With a sigh Daria follows]
<P>
[EXT House. Helen, Daria beside her, is in the driveway, calling for
Quinn. Jake, brandishing a flashlight, rushes on-screen to join them]
<P>
HELEN: QUINN! MARCH BACK FROM WHEREVER YOU ARE RIGHT
NOW, YOUNG LADY!
<P>
JAKE: WE'LL GIVE YOU TWENTY BUCKS IF YOU DO!
<P>
HELEN: (yelling while giving Jake a perturbed glance) NO WE WON'T!
YOU COME BACK HERE THIS MINUTE OR YOU'RE GROUNDED FROM
THE PHONE FOR A MONTH! (a beat, normal) Oh, this is getting us
nowhere!
<P>
JAKE: Let's see if she's around back!
<P>
[Jake and Daria follow Helen as she starts walking around the right
side of the house]
<P>
DARIA: With all that screaming you probably woke the people in the
backyard. Why don't we see if they know where Quinn is?
<P>
HELEN: (not listening) We will in a second, sweetie... (to Jake, snidely)
At least you didn't forget the flashlight this time.
<P>
JAKE: (annoyed) Oh sure, shift the blame to me! If we'd gone to Hawaii
like I wanted Quinn wouldn't be missing!
<P>
DARIA: Unless the natives offered her as a sacrifice to Toki-Tiki, like
the people in the backyard might if -
<P>
JAKE: (interrupting) BUT NO! We just had to go to El Paso to visit Amy
and that weirdo musician she's dating!
<P>
QUINN: (OS) Mom, Dad! There you are!
<P>
[They stop as Quinn, dragging something behind her, comes up. Jake
shines the flashlight in her direction]
<P>
HELEN: (relieved) Quinn, thank God! You had us so...
<P>
[Helen trails off and goes white with fright as she sees what Quinn is
holding – a leash with the dog from the painting on the end of it. Daria
and Jake, eyes wide, jump back]
<P>
JAKE: YAGH!
<P>
HELEN: Quinn, step away from the dog!
<P>
QUINN: Why? It's a cute puppy I found out in the dark near all those
weird people!
<P>
DARIA: Cute puppy's usually don't have teeth sharp enough to rip you
in half, Quinn.
<P>
QUINN: What are you talking - (she turns and sees what the dog really
looks like) AGH!
<P>
[She quickly drops the leash and rushes over to cower behind Jake and
Helen. The dog runs off in the opposite direction]
<P>
JANE: (VO) One day they're playing with Barbies, the next they're
worshiping Beelzebub. Sad, really.
<P>
TRICIA: (VO) What kind of hell beast runs away like that?
<P>
DARIA: (VO) The kind that's been to a vet from the ninth circle. I guess
the Master didn't want any hell pups running around.
<P>
[Helen and Jake lean down to face-level with Quinn]
<P>
HELEN: Quinn, you could have been hurt! You should never run away
like that!
<P>
JAKE: (back-up mode) Yeah, young lady!
<P>
QUINN: I was just trying to find a bathroom! I went out back and was
about to turn around, because the dark is so scary and this desert heat
is just killing my hair, which is why I brought -
<P>
HELEN: (patiently) How'd you find the dog, Quinn?
<P>
QUINN: (remembering) Oh, yeah! So I was about to go back in when I
saw a bunch of people who were asleep and then I felt something licking
my hand. At first I was scared but it barked so I figured it was a cute
puppy that had gotten lost in the desert. If I had known it was that ugly
I'd have never gone off with it!
<P>
DARIA: That would be a good policy for picking your dates in the future.
<P>
HELEN: (standing up) At least you're all right now and - wait, did you say
something about people?
<P>
QUINN: Yeah! There's a guy and a bunch of women in robes and stuff in
the backyard!
<P>
DARIA: (sighing) Note to self, people only listen to those with perfect
complexions.
<P>
JAKE: (standing up) Maybe they can help us!
<P>
DARIA: They didn't look like they were in a communicating mood, Dad.
<P>
[Helen &amp; Jake lead the girls around to the backyard. They spot the circle,
slowing their pace as they see the group is now awake. The Master is
addressing the wives, who are sitting around the pyre]
<P>
JAKE: (hushed) They look pretty alive to me! (aloud) Hey there -
<P>
HELEN: (hushed, interrupting) Wait, I think they're talking about us!
<P>
[We pan from the family to the cult, who are in the middle of an
argument]
<P>
WIFE #1: (a severe looking blonde) Who led the man and the children
here?
<P>
WIFE #2: (a red-head) It was Torgo! He let them in!
<P>
WIFE #3: (a haughty brunette) The man is of no use to us! We only
need the woman!
<P>
WIFE #4: (another brunette) Yes! We must rid ourselves of the man and
the children!
<P>
[A few of the other wives murmur in agreement]
<P>
WIFE #1: We must not kill the children! Manos loves beautiful women,
and they will grow up to be beautiful women! The Man yes, the child no!
<P>
[A few others mumble agreement with her]
<P>
MASTER: I have had enough of this bickering! They must all be
eliminated!
<P>
WIFE #1: It is against the law of Manos to harm a woman!
<P>
MASTER: Only I may interpret Manos' law! After tonight, I think your
service to us will be at it's end!
<P>
WIFE #1: (pointing to Wife #3) She started it!
<P>
WIFE #3: Did not!
<P>
TAD: (VO) Their god's name was "Hands?"
<P>
DARIA: (VO) For spotting that you get an extra carrot stick next time.
<P>
[Pan back to the Morgendorffers, or whether where they were. They've
long since run away]
<P>
[EXT Driveway, BGM Gary Cail's "Escape". The family comes running
from around the side of the house, not stopping till they reach the car.
They quickly jump in]
<P>
[INT Mini-Van, BGM fading as they catch their breath. Jake tries to start
the van]
<P>
JAKE: Start, damn it, START! We've got some sicko cult on our tails!
<P>
DARIA: (looking out her window) I think they're still back there arguing.
<P>
HELEN: We can't take that chance! Jake, let's go!
<P>
JAKE: The car won't start! Those freaks must have cast some Voodoo spell
on it!
<P>
DARIA: This is Texas, Dad. They're probably snake handlers.
<P>
JAKE: Well I'm gonna to find Torgo and make him help us!
<P>
HELEN: You're leaving us here unprotected?!
<P>
JAKE: Of course not! The tazer's in the glove compartment with the
gun! Speaking of which...
<P>
[He leans over and unlocks the glove compartment, pulling a .32
Magnum out along with the tazer. He hands the latter to Helen]
<P>
JAKE: Now lock all the doors and honk if anything happens!
<P>
HELEN: You're not going to kill Torgo, are you?
<P>
JAKE: Of course not! I'll check on those weirdo's and then pistol whip
Torgo like the man used to do to us! Be right back!
<P>
[Jake opens his door and jumps out, locking it behind him]
<P>
HELEN: (mumbling) If we live through this night I swear I will make you
pay, Jake Morgendorffer...
<P>
[EXT House. Jake is ranting to himself as he heads for the backyard]
<P>
JAKE: (muttering) I wanted to move someplace where there aren't cults,
but no! (imitating Helen) "There are more career opportunities in Texas
for me, Jake!" (normal) What about Jake's career?! We could've gone to
visit mom, but *no*, we gotta see Amy! I bet she's in a cult too -
<P>
[From out of nowhere Torgo runs up and strikes Jake over the head with
his staff, knocking him unconscious. Torgo pulls Jake over to the side of
the house and removes the latter's belt, tying him to a pole]
<P>
[INT Van. Helen is looking through some papers, giving the surrounding
area an occasional once-over. Quinn is off-screen, rummaging through
the floorboard. Daria is also on look-out]
<P>
QUINN: I can't find my Darcy's First Make-Up Kit!
<P>
DARIA: Maybe Torgo took it so he can look as pretty as he feels.
<P>
QUINN: Mom, can I go and see if I left in the house?
<P>
HELEN: (flipping through her papers) Absolutely not! We're staying put
till your father gets back! Now where did I put the Jergen's file...
<P>
QUINN: Maybe you took it inside!
<P>
HELEN: (realization) Damn, I did! Daria, wait here.
<P>
DARIA: I can see how helping some hypochondriacs sue over a little rash
outweighs my safety.
<P>
[Helen sorts through her purse, pulling out a can of mace and handing it
to Daria]
<P>
HELEN: Here's the mace just in case, but we'll be right back, I promise!
Honk if you see anything!
<P>
DARIA: Does that include coyotes, or just Dad screaming as he's chased
by knife-wielding psychos?
<P>
HELEN: Use your best judgment.
<P>
[Helen and Quinn exit. Daria locks up behind them. After a moment she
grows restless]
<P>
DARIA: Waiting here would be the smartest course of action, but knowing
Dad he probably tripped in a rabbit hole, and since this is likely my last
night on Earth, I can think of better places to spend it than here. (beat)
To my death it is.
<P>
[She makes her own exit]
<P>
JANE: (VO) And you complain about how cliched horror films are?
<P>
DARIA: (VO) Life is like a crappy horror film - contrived and badly acted.
<P>
[INT Bedroom. A nervous Helen is rummaging around in search of her
papers. Quinn comes running up from behind, carrying her toy compact]
<P>
QUINN: I found it! Daria was using it as a bookmark!
<P>
HELEN: (jumping) Don't do that, Quinn! Now sit still while I look for my
briefs!
<P>
[Quinn sits down on the bed. After a moment she looks back and sees
Torgo peeping through the window]
<P>
QUINN: (nervously) Uhm, Mom...
<P>
HELEN: (to herself) I was looking through it before Torgo pawed me...
<P>
QUINN: (louder) Mu-om, there's a -
<P>
HELEN: Quinn, if you want to help, try and find my papers!
<P>
QUINN: (insistently) But somebody's peeping at us through the window!
<P>
[Helen turns around and sees what Quinn has]
<P>
HELEN: EEP!
<P>
[She runs over and pulls the drape down, then back to shut and lock the
bedroom door]
<P>
HELEN: Oh God, Daria's still out there! I never should have left her
alone!
<P>
QUINN: She'll be fine, Mom, she's got the mace! Besides, even Torgo
wouldn't touch her!
<P>
HELEN: (lightly punching the door) Dammit, Jake, where are you?!
<P>
[EXT House, BGM Jon Spencer Blues Explosion "She Said". The moon
has broke through the clouds, allowing a little illumination. Daria is slowly
crawling along the back wall, keeping an eye on the cult and a finger on
the mace trigger. She sees several forms tussling around in the distance.
Curiosity gets the better of her and she stealthily makes her way over to
get a better look]
<P>
[EXT Cult Area, BGM continuing. Six of the wives are wrestling each
other]
<P>
DARIA: (OS, hushed) Great, now I'm in a Russ Myer movie.
<P>
TRICIA: (VO) Wouldn't someone flying overhead have seen them?
<P>
DARIA: (VO) You'd think so, but this is Texas we're talking about. Cults
are a dime a dozen down there.
<P>
JANE: (VO) If anyone did it'd probably be like, (bad Texas accents) "Hey,
Earl, see those women wrasslin' down there in sheer robes?" "Probly
some hippy cult. There's lots of 'em 'round here." Or something like
that.
<P>
[EXT House, BGM fading. Daria has resumed her search, turning the
corner when she spots Wife #3 in a one-sided make out session with
the unconscious Jake. Daria quickly hides. After a few minutes Wife
#3, perturbed at Jake's lack of response and slaps him a few times]
<P>
WIFE #3: Don't you ever do that again!
<P>
[She storms out of frame past Daria, who emerges a second later from
her hiding place. As she walks up to Jake he starts coming to]
<P>
JAKE: (mumbling) Wow, you haven't done that in years, honey...
(alert) Wha-hey!
<P>
[Daria comes to a stop near the pole]
<P>
DARIA: I'm putting this in my "Moments To Be Scarred By" file.
<P>
JAKE: Hey kiddo! Don't suppose you could help out your dear old dad?
<P>
DARIA: Do you have any idea how you got here?
<P>
JAKE: I was trying to find Torgo so I could do something to him -
strangle, I think - and then I felt a sharp pain. Had the weirdest dream,
too!
<P>
DARIA: So you don't remember the part where you were mauled by a
woman wearing a Victoria's Secret robe?
<P>
JAKE: What are you talking about... (it clicks) DAH! It was nothing,
Daria, I swear! (meekly) *Please* don't tell your mother!
<P>
DARIA: I believe you, Dad, but I'm a kid. You never know what I might
say the next time you refuse to buy me something.
<P>
JAKE: Ten?
<P>
DARIA: Thirty.
<P>
JAKE: Twenty?
<P>
DARIA: Twenty-five.
<P>
JAKE: Deal!
<P>
[Daria squats down and unties Jake. He pulls out his wallet and hands
her the money]
<P>
DARIA: (pointing to the gun) Uhm, Dad, you might need that.
<P>
JAKE: Oh yeah! (he picks it up) Uhm, never play with guns, Daria!
<P>
DARIA: Lead on, MacGruff.
<P>
[The rush off screen]
<P>
[INT Living Room. Jake and Daria run in]
<P>
JAKE: Helen? Where are you?!
<P>
[Quinn follows Helen as she runs out of the bedroom and embraces Jake]
<P>
HELEN: Jake, thank heavens! I saw Torgo peeping through the window
and locked the door! Are you all right?
<P>
JAKE: (nervously) Same as always, honey! Daria can verify it!
<P>
DARIA: The local wildlife was admiring him.
<P>
HELEN: We need to get out of here now!
<P>
JAKE: I know, let's hide in the desert!
<P>
DARIA: That sagebrush is very concealing.
<P>
QUINN: *Desert*?! But I'll get sand in my sneakers!
<P>
HELEN: I'll do anything to get out of this place!
<P>
JAKE: Great, let's go!
<P>
[EXT Cult Area. The wives have stopped tussling and are now watching
the Master berate Torgo]
<P>
MASTER: It was you who brought them here, and now you will suffer the
consequences!
<P>
TORGO: <I>But MasteR... </I><P>
<P>
MASTER: Silence! Manos decrees that you pay the ultimate price!
<P>
[He pushes Torgo down onto the slab. The wives rhythmically dance
around the prone Torgo for a few minutes before rubbing him for
unknown and unfathomable reasons]
<P>
JANE: (VO) Hold on! How’d you know what they did to Torgo?
<P>
DARIA: (VO) I'm elaborating, but they did something to him.
<P>
TRICIA: (VO) What was that?
<P>
[EXT Desert. The Morgendorffers are running as fast as they can.
Jake is carrying Quinn in his arms while Helen holds Daria's hand.
The family stops as Torgo runs by, screaming and holding his flaming
foot]
<P>
TORGO: <I>HoT foot, hOt foot, Ow ow OW...! </I><P>
<P>
[After a look of confusion amongst themselves, the family resumes
running. A few yards away from a dirt road Helen slips in a cow pie,
taking Daria down with her]
<P>
HELEN: Dammit!
<P>
[Jake sets Quinn down and goes to check on Helen as Daria pulls herself
up]
<P>
JAKE: Honey, are you alright?
<P>
HELEN: (clutching her ankle) I think I sprained my ankle!
<P>
DARIA: I think I fractured my pride.
<P>
QUINN: Mu-*om*, there's a cult right behind us...
<P>
HELEN: (sitting up) Just let me rest for a minute! I knew I shouldn't
have put off taking up jogging!
<P>
JAKE: Hey, why don't we go back to the house! They'd never look for
us there!
<P>
HELEN: (shooting up, the pain forgotten) THAT IS THE SINGLE
STUPIDEST IDEA I HAVE EVER HEARD!
<P>
DARIA: Have to agree with her, Dad. Where would we hide once we
got there?
<P>
JAKE: The door frame?
<P>
[At Helen and the girls perturbed looks, Jake starts backing up]
<P>
JAKE: Hey, if anyone has a better idea, go right ahead and -
<P>
[He backs up into the Master]
<P>
JAKE: Eep!
<P>
[Jake simultaneously jumps forward and turns to face the Master. Helen
and the girls back up in horror]
<P>
HELEN: Oh God, no!
<P>
JAKE: (nervous) Hey, fancy seeing you here!
<P>
[The Master just stares at them. After a beat Jake pulls the gun out of
his shorts, aiming it at him]
<P>
JAKE: Don't make me use this! If you come one step closer... well, I'll
do something!
<P>
[The Master continues to stare]
<P>
HELEN: What are you waiting for, Jake? Shoot him!
<P>
JAKE: (out of the side of his mouth) But he's not really doing anything,
Helen!
<P>
DARIA: Maybe if you hit him on the side he'll unfreeze.
<P>
[Headlights flash over the family and the Master as a low roar sounds in
the background. We see a red Lamborghini, followed by a Highway
Patrol cruiser, park a few feet away. The door pops open and Amy,
glasses on and wearing jeans with a shirt reading "ORBITAL LAWNCHAIR
TOUR 1991" squeezes out of the tight confines of her car]
<P>
AMY: (mumbling) Knew I should have gotten the Porsche... (aloud,
spotting the family) Helen, Jake! (she walks over to them) I thought
that was your van outside! What happened?
<P>
DARIA: Just the usual murderous hi-jinks that go hand in hand with
family vacations.
<P>
[In the background two patrolmen exit their vehicle. As they walk over,
the wives catch up to the group. The officers head off to question them]
<P>
HELEN: Oh thank God it's you, Amy! We were making perfectly good
time when Jake decided to try one his hair-brained short cuts -
<P>
JAKE: (bitter) And you're one to talk, Miss A-Hundred-Tickets-At-
Last-Count?
<P>
HELEN: Oh stuff it, Jake!
<P>
AMY: (to herself) Good thing I have a couch... (aloud) Go on.
<P>
HELEN: ANYWAYS, we stopped for directions at this cottage and met
a sick cult who've been trying to molest and kill us all night!
<P>
AMY: Cult, what... (she notices the Master, realization) Oh, that cult.
(she walks over to the Master) Hi, Ronald. How's the cult going?
<P>
MASTER: I am the Master now!
<P>
HELEN: You know this freak? Oh what am I saying, of course you do...
<P>
JAKE: I knew she was in a cult!
<P>
AMY: (turning back to face them) The only cult I'm in is the cult of Alan
Rickman, Jake. Ron and I dated after I first moved here. Then he got
involved with this Mentos thing -
<P>
MASTER: It's *Manos*!
<P>
AMY: (cont.) - and started hanging with some guy from the local
sideshow. Where is Torgo anyway?
<P>
DARIA: Putting out a flame even Neosporin can't help.
<P>
[The cops start leading several wives away as another cruiser pulls up.
Two more patrolmen exit and start towards the family and the Master]
<P>
MASTER: SILENCE, ALL OF YOU! Manos has decreed that I take this
woman and her daughters as my brides! I also need a new demonic
henchman, so -
<P>
JAKE: (swinging to face the Master) Wait a darn minute! You want to
MARRY my wife and kids?! No pedophile's gonna touch my little girls!
<P>
[Jake leaps at the Master, knocking him down. We hear brutal fight
noises from off-screen. The cops rush over to intervene]
<P>
HELEN: (turning to Amy) So you dumped him after he joined the cult?
<P>
AMY: No, that wasn't till I caught him and Torgo peeping through my
bedroom window.
<P>
DARIA: I guess the Barksdale women are just irresistible.
<P>
QUINN: (walking up to Amy) Aunt Amy, do you have a bathroom?
<P>
AMY: (monotone) Yes, Quinn, but there's a ten dollar charge for using it.
<P>
QUINN: No problem! Let's roll!
<P>
[She runs off and hops into the Lamborghini]
<P>
[FADE TO INT Gupty's Bedroom. Tricia is asleep, Tad slowly drifting off]
<P>
TAD: (sleepily) Did the Master really have supernatural powers?
<P>
DARIA: He just slept for long periods of times and stared at people.
<P>
JANE: Kind of like Trent and Andrea.
<P>
TAD: Good night, Daria and Jane...
<P>
DARIA: Good night, John Boy.
<P>
[Daria and Jane exit the room, turning the light off and closing the door
softly]
<P>
[INT Gupty House Hallway. Daria and Jane start down the stairs]
<P>
JANE: Cool story, but it could have used a vampire.
<P>
DARIA: I'm sure there was one in another of my repressed memories.
Give me a week.
<P>
JANE: Come to think of it, how do you know what happened to Helen and
Jake?
<P>
DARIA: I was a witness in "Morgendorffer vs. Manos". Turns out he was
an insurance salesman from Houston.
<P>
[EXT Lane House, a few hours later. BGM Type O Negative's "Black No.

[INT Lane Living Room. BGM fades as Daria and Jane enter. Trent walks
on-screen to greet them]
<P>
TRENT: Hey, Janey, hey Daria. I need an opinion on something I'm
thinking of adding to the opening of Spiral's show.
<P>
DARIA: If I hear anything about crucifixes made out of TV's, I'm out of
here.
<P>
TRENT: Nah, just some synth sounds. I've been fooling around on the
MIDI keyboard all night.
<P>
JANE: Now you use it for something besides sampling your electronic
Yahtzee game?
<P>
[The camera pans with Trent as he walks over towards the couch, where
the keyboard is set up]
<P>
TRENT: I got a sample off that puppet show you two are always watching.
<P>
JANE: It's not a puppet show!
<P>
TRENT: Whatever. Listen!
<P>
[He punches a playback button. A synth version of "Torgo's Theme"
starts playing. After a brief shock, Daria recovers]
<P>
TRENT: Well, what do you think?
<P>
DARIA: It has a beat you can dance to, if your idea of dance music is
anything by Charles Manson.

<P>POINTS OF NON-INTREST

<P>WHAT IS MANOS AND WHY PARODY IT?
<P>"Manos": The Hands of Fate is THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE.  That's
capitalized for a reason.  Plan 9?  Amateurish.  Batman &amp; Robin?  Child's play.
They pale before the horror that is Manos.  Incompetently written, directed, acted,
edited, lit, and probably catered, this lump of pure pain was the brainchild of Harold
P. Warren, a fertilizer salesman from Texas.  You simply have to see it for yourself,
and even then I urge you to watch the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 version
(available on DVD, also containing the original unedited film) as a buffer.

<P>As for the genesis of this unnecessary crossover, you can blame a twisted thought
tangent I went off on after reading too many fanfics and watching too much MST3K.
"Manos" was made in El Paso, Texas.  Daria made reference to El Paso in her
conditioning rant from "The Lab Brat", which in turn played a part in the concept
of Amy being Daria's real mother in Nicole's "Relativity", which IIRC spawned that
clich&eacute;.  Orbital Lawnchair is a reference to Nemo Blank's "Too Many Choices", which
also dealt with that subject.  Factor in Mike Judge's statement Beavis &amp; Butthead was
set in Texas, and you see why I should be kept away from a keyboard.

<P>TORGO'S VOICE
<P>Hopefully the italics stopped you from imagining it ala DeMartino's voice,
because it isn't.  You have to hear it to get the full impact.  Mike Nelson, host of
MST3K, does a very funny imitation of this "classic" character.

<P>THE CULT
<P>Why so few scenes involving the cult?  Why not?  Basically they argue, the fight,
they argue, they fight... you get the idea.  We have Helen and Jake for that.  Torgo
is rubbed and slapped around following the dancing, but dies off-screen after the
Master burns his hand off.  Trivia: The MST version cuts out the family finding
Torgo's body and a scene where the Master beats Wife #1 to death.  Warren
apparently didn't know the line between horrifying and loathsome.

<P>AND THE AWARD FOR STUPIDEST FILM FAMILY GOES TO...
<P>If you think Jake can be clueless, just watch the dad in this movie, as portrayed
by Warren.  All signs point to it being a bad idea to stay there, but they end up
spending what seems to be all night there.  Yeah, the car won't start and the
father's unconscious for several hours, but the sight of Torgo (who tries in vain
to warn them off) alone should have sent him packing.  The wife isn't much better,
becoming a tearful wreck and deciding not to tell her husband about Torgo's pass
(no way could I see Helen doing that) while the daughter does little more than
whine for her dead puppy, a subplot I briefly considered for Quinn before settling
on the bathroom gag.  As for going back into the house to hide, I wish I had made
that up.

<P>SPOT-THE-REHASH
<P>A number of lines and scenes were "inspired" or outright ripped-off from the MST
version, and a few key sequences taken from the Simpsons.  I don't like to go into
detail on every single reference, and I'm sure most readers will have spotted them.

<P>And thus my first Daria fic is completed.  I urge all complaints, grievances, and
death threats sent to cdm2012@ntin.net.  I could use all the critiques, outright
flames, and "not-so-nice try"'s I can get.  My only experience in fan-fiction
have been a number of MiSTings and the occasional Doctor Who story (most of
which I'd like to forget).  Thanks for reading, or some other pithy last note.
