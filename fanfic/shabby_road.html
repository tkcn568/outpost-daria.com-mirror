<P><I>I should mention that if you really, REALLY want to enjoy this, you should familiarize yourself with Abbey Road before reading. You don't have to but you'll enjoy it more if you do. Plus Abbey Road is a classic that everyone should hear. Your local library likely has a copy. I hope you enjoy reading this as much as I enjoyed writing it. Keep in mind, better work than this is on the horizon.</I>

<P><h2>Maxwell's Silver Teardrops</h2>
<P>
<P>Max was driving late one night on the interstate
<P>Doing eighty five
<P>The limit's not that high and he should have kno-o-o-own
<P>Sgt. Matthew Amerol of the state police patrol
<P>Sees our friend drive by
<P>He gives a little sigh as he starts pursui-ui-ui-uit
<P>But as he's walking up to the car
<P>Max loses control
<P>
<P><h4>Wah! Wah!
<P>Maxwell's silver teardrops are running down his cheeks
<P>Wah! Wah! 
<P>Maxell's sobbing so hard that he can barely speak</h4>
<P>
<P>Two more weeks go by, Max upsets another guy
<P>During a rock show
<P>He pokes fun at his 'fro and the dude gets ma-a-a-ad
<P>Mystik Spiral takes the stage but the man is still enraged
<P>Max still won't shut up
<P>So this dude climbs up and attacks the ba-a-a-and
<P>And as he's grabbing Max by the neck
<P>The boy can't hold it in
<P>
<P><h4>Wah! Wah!
<P>Maxwell's silver teardrops are running down his cheeks
<P>Wah! Wah! 
<P>Maxell's sobbing so hard that he can barely speak</h4>
<P>
<P>Later in the hospital, who shows up but Amerol
<P>Coming to arrest
<P>And as I can atest, Max was less than thri-i-i-illed
<P>Max didn't hesistate, tried to use the fire escape
<P>Just to get away
<P>Got trapped there for three days in the freezing co-o-o-old
<P>At last they saw him stuck way up there
<P>And guess what that boy did
<P>
<P><h4>Wah! Wah!

<P><h2>1515 Broadway</h2>
<P>
<P>Don't want to be
<P>On MTV
<P>At 1515 Broadway in New York
<P>All their shows stink, that's what I think
<P>At 1515 Broadway in New York
<P>I hope the whole nation will see
<P>How they treat good shows on MTV
<P>
<P><h4>Don't want to be

<P>
<P>There's the Real World
<P>It makes me hurl
<P>All those whiny kids under one roof
<P>There's Andy Dick
<P>He makes me sick
<P>I never laughed at any of his spoofs
<P>If their shows don't make you frown
<P>They cancel good shows like Downtown
<P>
<P><h4>Don't want to be
<P>On MTV
<P>At 1515 Broadway in New York</h4>

<P>
<P>Hiding in the back of the Zon club
<P>This mob of diehard shipper is mad
<P>They say "Trent you're a creep becasue you're dating Monique

<P>Caught a cab and headed downtown
<P>But it was just my bad luck that the driver spoke up
<P>He said "You really let you followers down!"
<P>
<P><h4>These fanatics annoy me

<P>
<P>After we have both finished eating

<P>He says "I really do feel bad for you man!"
<P>
<P><h4>These fanatics annoy me
