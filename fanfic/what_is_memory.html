<blockquote><b>What is Memory?</b> By Love Gordon
<br>A sort-of sequel to Behind The Pom-Poms. Daria finds a baby in the
snow. Quinn
<br>quits the Fashion Club. Oh, and the United States is almost taken over
by Communists...
<p><b><a href="#listen2somecoolshit">Recommended Listening</a></b>
<p><b>Part One</b>
<br>&nbsp;Quinn peered into the window of Dega Street Books, but she didn't
see her sister.
<br>Suddenly, the door next to her opened. The bell jangled loudly, and
Quinn jumped about a
<br>foot into the air.
<br>&nbsp;"Eep!" she shrieked.
<br>&nbsp;"Calm down, Quinn. Too much Ritalin isn't good for your system."
Her older sister
<br>patted her on the back. Quinn still didn't move. Whether she was trying
to figure out what
<br>her sister had said or if she was still in shock was anyone's guess.
<br>&nbsp;"Come on, Tonto, we've got to get a move on. Christmas shopping's
done. Mom's
<br>going to meet us at the Sound Hole in fifteen minutes, and we'll be
late if we don't hurry
<br>up." said Daria.
<br>&nbsp;Quinn sighed. "Alright, let's go. Just don't surprise me like
that again."
<br>&nbsp;As they walked off, Quinn asked, "Why do you always call me Tonto?"
<br>&nbsp;"Someday, I'll tell you, sis..."
<br>&nbsp;*****
<br>&nbsp;"Daria..." Quinn muttered. She jogged her elbow. Daria sighed.
<br>&nbsp;"Yes, Quinn?" she replied. They were standing outside the Sound
Hole.
<br>&nbsp;"I quit the Fashion Club."
<br><i>&nbsp;"What?!?"</i>
<br>&nbsp;This time, it was Quinn who sighed. "It's kind of long and complicated,
but since
<br>there were a lot of openings in the Latin club, I signed up. I really
do like Latin!" she said
<br>to Daria's incredulous face. "But Sandi was being a total jerk about
it, so I told her that she
<br>was full of <i>faeces tauri</i>. I walked out of the meeting. The Fashion
Club kind of collapsed
<br>on its butt on my heels."
<br>&nbsp;"Wow, Quinn. I have to say, I'm impressed." And Daria was. Her
sister had done a
<br>lot of growing up in the last year and a half, while she was away.
Now Quinn was a senior,
<br>she herself in her second year of college. "But won't it look bad on
your college
<br>application?"
<br>&nbsp;"Daria!" Quinn dissolved in giggles. "You really thought the
Fashion Club was a
<br><i>school activity?</i> It was just a bunch of really popular freshman
girls hanging out together.
<br>We called ourselves the Fashion Club because Sandi thought it sounded
official, though we
<br><i>did</i> function as a club until Stacy left last year." Quinn looked
sad about the latter.
<br><i>&nbsp;Too bad</i>, thought Daria. Stacy had been Quinn's only <i>real</i>
friend, and now she was
<br>in some student exchange program in Australia so she could be with
her boyfriend, Ted.
<br>&nbsp;Quinn spoke up. "Hey, wasn't Mom supposed to be here a while
ago?"
<br>&nbsp;Daria looked at her watch, and at the snow now lightly falling
on the road. "Yeah...
<br>That's weird." She turned on her cell phone. "I'll call Mom."
<br>&nbsp;*****
<br>&nbsp;Helen Morgendorffer was stuck. She and Jake would have to rent
a hotel room, that
<br>was all. The office's holiday party was in Leeville, and now, according
to the radio
<br>announcer, the town was snowed in.
<br>&nbsp;Suddenly her phone rang.
<br>&nbsp;"Mom! Where are you?" yelped her eldest daughter at the sound
of her voice.
<br>&nbsp;"I'm in Leeville, honey. I almost forgot about this party, and
my boss called to
<br>remind me just in time. By the way, we'll be spending the night: we're
snowed in. Why are
<br>you calling?" Helen replied.
<br>&nbsp;"You were supposed to pick us up at the Sound Hole thirty minutes
ago! And it's
<br>snowing."
<br>&nbsp;Helen gasped. "Oh my god, I totally forgot about it. Are you
two all right?"
<br>&nbsp;"Safe and unharmed. However, we're going to turn into popsicles
soon. Don't
<br>worry-" Daria said, anticipating her mother's shriek of anguish, "I'll
get one of the Lanes to
<br>drive us home."
<br>&nbsp;"Okay."
<br>&nbsp;They said good-bye and hung up, and Helen flopped onto a couch
with sigh. Why
<br>couldn't she be a better mother? Even Daria took better care of Quinn
than she did.
<br>&nbsp;Jake sat down next to her and handed her a Martini. Well, at
least one
<br>Morgendorffer around here remembered things.
<br>&nbsp;*****
<br>&nbsp;"One of the Lanes?" Quinn raised her eyebrow suspiciously. <i>She</i>
knew what was
<br>going on here. "I knew it! You've been seeing Trent all this time!
Why don't you <i>tell</i> me
<br>these things?"
<br>&nbsp;Daria raised a hand to silence her. "Whoa. Wait a minute, sister.
Before you go off
<br>hitching us up and marrying us in Las Vegas, let's face the facts.
Just because he and I both
<br>live in New York City doesn't mean we're dating. Hell, Jane and I are
so busy at Julliard
<br>and Columbia, respectively, that we don't have time for that sort of
thing."
<br>&nbsp;Quinn frowned at her. "<i>Daria</i>..."
<br>&nbsp;"So we went out for pizza. Once!"
<br>&nbsp;Quinn kept frowning.
<br>&nbsp;"Okay, three times."
<br>&nbsp;"Hm."
<br>&nbsp;"Quinn, don't look at me like that. So it was three pizzas and
a movie!"
<br>&nbsp;"Hm."
<br>&nbsp;"Okay, Quinn, you win."
<br>&nbsp;"...."
<br><i>&nbsp;"Quinn!"</i>
<br>&nbsp;*****
<br>&nbsp;Daria peered in the window of the Sound Hole. She was slightly
startled when the
<br>door beside her swung open, but only slightly.
<br>&nbsp;"Hey, Trent." she said. A little too breathlessly. "Quinn and
I are stranded here.
<br>Can you give us a lift home?"
<br>&nbsp;"Sure thing." he replied with a smile. "Hey, Daria, how's it
been?" She hadn't seen
<br>him in a few days, now that she thought about it.
<br>&nbsp;"Cool. You?"
<br>&nbsp;"Yeah. Just checking in with Jesse. I've been in the basement
for a couple of days,
<br>putting in some acoustic tile. We're setting up a recording studio
there."
<br>&nbsp;"Really? I didn't know you two were still working together."
<br>&nbsp;"Well, since I started my own record label in New York, I thought
it would only be
<br>fitting if Jesse and I were the next ones to ascend to fame." Trent's
digital media label had
<br>been the first to release their music exclusively in mp3 format. Babyboomers
screamed in
<br>outrage. Teens loved it, and immediately propelled PennyLane records
to major label
<br>status. All five of its first signees had gone on to become platinum
downloads within a
<br>week. New technology encoding the files prevented Napster-like happenings
from
<br>sabotaging the label, as well.
<br>&nbsp;Daria, who ran the website and had played a crucial part in the
development of
<br>PennyLane Records' patented encoding software, nodded in agreement.
"Yeah, that'd be
<br>great."
<br>&nbsp;"Come on, guys, let's head for the car." said Quinn. The three
strolled down the
<br>sidewalk to the car.
<br>&nbsp;*****
<br>&nbsp;<i>A woman in a soft, clingy black dress climbed out of a silver
Mercedes. To the</i>
<br><i>chauffeur, she murmured to keep the car waiting for her. He nodded,
and she walked up</i>
<br><i>the sidewalk with a warm bundle in her arms, swaddled cozily in
a thick, grey wool</i>
<br><i>blanket.</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;She kissed the child that was the bundle on its forehead.
The woman who was</i>
<br><i>staying inside was someone she knew she could trust with this, her
most precious</i>
<br><i>creation. If only she could keep her baby with her... But it would
be dangerous enough.</i>
<br><i>She had to leave.</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;She pinned the note to the warm blanket.</i>
<br><b><i>&nbsp;<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Daria,</font></font></i></b>
<br><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>&nbsp;I know that
you, of all people, will be as good and</font></font></i></b>
<br><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>kind to my baby as
I, her mother, would be. Her name is</font></font></i></b>
<br><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Amalia Vivianne, and
she is six months old. Trust in me, I</font></font></i></b>
<br><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>will be back for her.
If I am not, my lawyers will reach</font></font></i></b>
<br><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>you, for in my will
it says where she is. I pray Amalia is</font></font></i></b>
<br><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>not a burden to you,
but there is nowhere else to go.</font></font></i></b>
<br><i>&nbsp;The woman in black wiped a tear off her cheek and settled
her daughter on the</i>
<br><i>doorstep. Then she walked back to the car, and she was gone.</i>
<p><b>Part Two</b>
<br>&nbsp;"A baby on your doorstep?" inquired Jane, once they were safely
in the Lane
<br>fortress, a home familiar with babies and fleeing Morgendorffers. "Do
you have any idea
<br>whose it could be?"
<br>&nbsp;"No idea," Daria replied, cradling the baby. She was a beautiful
little girl, with soft
<br>golden hair. "The note... well, read it for yourself."
<br>&nbsp;"Oh, so there's a note?" Daria handed it to her, and Jane quickly
scanned it.
<br>"Interesting."
<br>&nbsp;Quinn had gone upstairs, to dump her stuff in Penny's room, but
Trent, who stood
<br>behind her, peered over her shoulder curiously. "She's a cute baby."
he said. "Nowhere
<br>else to go, she said?"
<br>&nbsp;"Yeah. It's really funny. I mean, who do we know who might have
a baby?"
<br>&nbsp;"Jodie- well, we can cross Jodie and Mack off. Amalia's too pale."
said Jane
<br>&nbsp;"Let's call her Molly." Daria said. Right now, Molly was sleeping
contentedly. <i>I</i>
<br><i>could get used to this</i>, she thought.
<br>&nbsp;"'Kay. Andrea-"
<br>&nbsp;"Straight Edge, and anti-drugs, anti-alcohol activism. Really
unlikely."
<br>&nbsp;"True. Guys?"
<br>&nbsp;"Upchuck- no one in their right minds would mate with him. Kevin-
married and
<br>working in the fast-food industry. Two kids, with that cheerleader
Angie. Ted- in Australia
<br>with Stacy. They probably haven't even gotten to first base yet."
<br>&nbsp;"Hmm... Monique?"
<br>&nbsp;"Jane, she's not only a lesbian, she's a single, lonely, depressed
lesbian."
<br>&nbsp;"She is? How do you know?"
<br>&nbsp;"I am so happy that there happened to be a bus waiting outside
the Zen that night."
<br><i>&nbsp;"She made a pass at you?!?"</i>
<br>&nbsp;"I never said that!"
<br>&nbsp;Trent cleared his throat. "Umm, Janey, aren't we getting a little
off the subject
<br>here?"
<br>&nbsp;"You're not freaked out? I'm freaked out! This girl was your
girlfriend, Trent!" Jane
<br>yelped.
<br>&nbsp;"Look, when she called me Jill when were... you know... I kind
of guessed that she
<br>swung both ways."
<br>&nbsp;"<i>Too</i> much information!" Daria said, backing away. "Molly
doesn't need to hear
<br>this. Do you, Molly?"
<br>&nbsp;Molly opened her eyes, smiled cherubicly, and burped.
<br>&nbsp;*****
<br>&nbsp;"So, you're quitting school to write a book, work in a record
label, and raise a baby
<br>that was left on your doorstep?" Helen said incredulously. They were
in the kitchen of the
<br>Morgendorffer home.
<br>&nbsp;Daria nodded. "It was a sign, Mom. My scholarship wouldn't allow
enough money
<br>to feed me and Molly, and I couldn't give her up. She's... mine now.
Besides, I'm a CEO,
<br>not a mere employee. It's a good job. It pays well."
<br>&nbsp;"Well, Daria, I hope you know what you're doing. I'm just worried
about telling
<br>Jake..."
<br>&nbsp;"Don't worry, Mom. I broke the news to him. He was playing with
Molly. He
<br>looked at her, then at me, and said, 'Can Grandpa Jakey visit?' Personally,
I think he took it
<br>well."
<br>&nbsp;"Well enough, indeed. So, where are you staying? Now that you're
not going back
<br>to your dorm and all."
<br>&nbsp;"I'm crashing at Trent's for now."
<br>&nbsp;"Trent? Daria, I didn't even know you were <i>dating</i> him.
And you're moving in
<br><i>already</i>?"
<br>&nbsp;"No, no! It's not like that! I'm just camping out on the couch
until I find an apartment.
<br>Jane's roommate smokes, drinks, and has orgies on Monday nights, so
I figured I'd better
<br>stay clear of her place."
<br>&nbsp;Helen, who had been standing in front of the stove, plucked the
screeching kettle off
<br>the burner and poured water into two mugs, adding two tea bags in the
process. "Good. We
<br>don't want another headfirst-in-the-guacamole heart attack."
<br>&nbsp;Daria chuckled. "Just wait until he finds about Quinn quitting
the Fashion Club."
<br>&nbsp;"She quit the <i>Fashion Club</i>?"
<br>&nbsp;"Yeah. Didn't she tell you?"
<br>&nbsp;Helen shook her head. "She never tells me anything now. Even
you told me more
<br>about what was going on. Now, she just leaves the house and I just
have to assume she's
<br>over at her boyfriend's house."
<br>&nbsp;"Quinn has a boyfriend? This, I need to hear."
<br>&nbsp;"That nice Sloane boy you used to date. Thomas?"
<br>&nbsp;"Tom." Daria raised her eyebrows. "Well, tell her to use protection."
<br><i>&nbsp;"Daria!"</i>
<br>&nbsp;*****
<br>&nbsp;"So. This is it." Daria eyed the living room, and Trent hoped
it would be okay for a
<br>short stay. He'd fixed up well enough for himself, but seeing it through
a stranger's eyes
<br>made it look a bit shabby. The furnace worked well enough, though;
it was still chilly in the
<br>middle of January.
<br>&nbsp;"What, you've never seen my apartment before?" he said jokingly.
<br>&nbsp;"Nope, actually. You moved in, um, probably in early November,
I was busy with
<br>term papers, etc., and I missed the housewarming party because of the
flu." said Daria,
<br>who, in fact, actually wasn't looking so hot.
<br>&nbsp;"Weird. You feeling okay, Daria?"
<br>&nbsp;"Not really. I haven't had a decent night of sleep since Molly
showed up. I'd kill for
<br>a night off. She's a sweet girl, Trent, but she has a ravenous appetite
at 3 in the morning that
<br>can't be neglected." Daria sighed. "She's adjusting, but she must have
been a terror as
<br>newborn."
<br>&nbsp;"Yikes. Listen, why don't you take a nap? I'll look after Molly
for a little bit."
<br>&nbsp;"Trent, you are a saviour sent from God. Her stuff is in the
diaper bag." And with
<br>that, Daria collapsed on the couch.
<br>&nbsp;*****
<br>&nbsp;After a night of Molly-watching, Trent began to see why Daria
was losing her
<br>sleep. Molly was a sleepy angel during daytime, but at night she stayed
awake. Her
<br>schedule was getting reset, but it was obvious her mother- whoever
she was- must have
<br>been accustomed to staying up all night for some reason. That was interesting.
<br>&nbsp;*****
<br><i>&nbsp;The woman stood up and shook hands with her chief officer.
She did not wear</i>
<br><i>black now, but a loose azure dress that outlined and emphasized
her perfect body.</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;Another, man entered the vast, immense room, and he kissed
her on the cheek</i>
<br><i>half-heartedly. He spoke to her for a moment, and her face fell
from its former</i>
<br><i>enthusiasm. She dismissed her chief, and the woman and the second
man, who was quite</i>
<br><i>tall, sat down at a table.</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;The woman spoke first. "Amalia is safe. I have made sure of
that."</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;However, the man shook his head. "With the one you told me
about? Won't she</i>
<br><i>suspect?"</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;"She will, Lorenzo. And Amalia will be safest. You didn't
know me then. I was not</i>
<br><i>Ani then." She pronounced Ani as Ah-<b>nee</b>.</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;Lorenzo was not satisfied. "Ani, they will find out."</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;"Amalia is not <b>her</b> daughter, Lorenzo. She being the
girl I was. My name was</i>
<br><i>different, then. There is much you don't know."</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;"Like what?"</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;"Amalia's father and I are married. This is a breach of protocol,
for he did not</i>
<br><i>want them to find me, you understand. We would have parted, but
by then I was</i>
<br><i>already..." Ani blushed. "He <b>will</b> be found, you understand?
If not, I will die trying.</i>
<br><i>Amalia is in better hands than mine."</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;"We have a lead."</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;"Where?"</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;"Uzbekistan."</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;"Godspeed, Lorenzo."</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;"Goodnight, Ani."</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;Lorenzo left the room before he could see Ani's eyes empty
with pain. <b>Where</b> was</i>
<br><i>Amalia's father?</i>
<p><b>Part Three</b>
<br>&nbsp;Daria awoke lying on a soft couch in Trent's living. She looked
at the time. 10 am.
<br>Ah, fifteen hours of sheer bliss: sleep. She rolled over and closed
her eyes.
<br>&nbsp;Then she sat straight up. <i>Where is Molly?</i>, she thought,
panicking. She should have
<br>been asleep in her crib next to Daria, but no, she wasn't there! Now
Daria was worried.
<br>&nbsp;She knocked on Trent's door, and he came out, carrying Molly.
<br>&nbsp;"Oh, there you are, Molly!" Daria exclaimed, scooping the little
girl up. "Thanks,
<br>Trent. I was out for hours. You get any sleep?"
<br>&nbsp;"Yup." Trent replied. "I got up once to give her a bottle and
change her diaper, but
<br>after I put her to sleep with her blanket she dozed off."
<br>&nbsp;"Her blanket?"
<br>&nbsp;"Yeah, the one she came wrapped in. Doesn't she always sleep
with it?"
<br>&nbsp;Daria smacked herself on the forehead with her free hand. "So
that's why she never
<br>sleeps! I should've known." She sighed. "I feel just like my mom. I'll
never be a good
<br>mother."
<br>&nbsp;"Look, you've been re-arranged your entire life to accommodate
Molly. I think that
<br>says something." Trent patted her on the back.
<br>&nbsp;"I guess. It's just such a hard job. I love her to pieces but-"
<br>&nbsp;"I know. It would be easier if you didn't have to do it all by
yourself."
<br>&nbsp;"How do you know?"
<br>&nbsp;"Janey. I was changing diapers before I lost my first teeth."
<br>&nbsp;"Ouch."
<br>&nbsp;*****
<br>&nbsp;Jane's roommate, Cassie (another former Lawndale resident), had
just lit up a
<br>cigarette. She inhaled deeply.
<br>&nbsp;"Listen, J. I hear ya out. I know ya think Molly-girl's gonna
stay here forever, grow
<br>up, and when's she's in college her real Ma's gonna show up and do
the hello routine. But I
<br>just don't know. The note- it just doesn't sound like a college student
ditching a baby on
<br>somebody's doorstep 'cuz she can't afford to take care of it."
<br>&nbsp;"Why do you think that?" asked Jane, adding a slash of green
to her painting. She
<br>and the easel stood in front of the room's window.
<br>&nbsp;"Well, it's to <i>Daria</i>, of all people. And somebody's gotta
know her schedule well to
<br>know she's in Lawndale for a week of the Christmas hols. And then there's
that shit about
<br>the will. Come on, who would have a freakin' will unless it's important?"
<br>&nbsp;"True." Jane frowned in thought. "I'd thought about that myself.
Molly's divine,
<br>Cass, and I'd hate to lose her, but one wonders. Her mom was no illiterate
slob. Judging by
<br>the blanket Molly came with, I'd say she's not poor, either. Who on
earth could have parted
<br>with such a sweet baby, as well? And 'there was nowhere else to go.'"
<br>&nbsp;"J, can I let you in on a secret?" Cassie took another drag on
her cigarette, and blew
<br>smoke delicately out.
<br>&nbsp;"Sure."
<br>&nbsp;"You remember Brittany Taylor?"
<br>&nbsp;"You bet I do. Blond bimbo, cheerleader?"
<br>&nbsp;"Yeah. Listen, she wasn't always that way. She- well, she disappeared
for about six
<br>months, after her mom tried to kill herself and left for California.
Brit used to listen to riot
<br>grrrl music, didn't bleach her hair, which was honey blonde, and she
was real smart. She
<br>drew a lot. She wanted to be an artist.
<br>&nbsp;"When she came back from her hiatus, she transferred to Lawndale's
public school system.
<br>I was her best friend. She came to me, and told me to forget anything
that she'd ever said or done before.
<br>To forget about her. And when she ran away, I always wondered where
she really went."
<br>&nbsp;"She went to California, Cass. To be with her mother." Jane said,
mystified.
<br>&nbsp;Cassie just looked at her. "J., you crack me up. You mean you
really thought her
<br>mom was in California?"
<br>&nbsp;"She's <i>not</i>?"
<br>&nbsp;"Well, that's where she left for. But everyone knows what happened.
Viv Taylor
<br>missed her connecting flight in Chicago, rented a boat, and drove out
on Lake Michigan.
<br>She had bought one of those fifty-pound benchpress weights in a store
somewhere. She tied
<br>a long rope to it. The other end she tied to her ankle. However, some
fisherman saw this,
<br>and one of them was able to pull her up. It was relatively shallow
where she was, her head
<br>was only five feet below sea level. But she's been in a hospital in
New York ever since.
<br>She's slightly brain damaged from being underwater so long, over a
minute."
<br>&nbsp;"Whoa." Jane was shocked. "So, do you mean that Brittany killed
herself?"
<br>&nbsp;"No one knows. I believe she's alive. She's left tracks, ya know?
Over two years ago, can you
<br>believe it? I know why she left, too."
<br>&nbsp;"How come? She seemed so happy."
<br>&nbsp;"She wasn't. When she disappeared the first time, she was committed
to Manson Asylum. I
<br>assume she faked her way out, because I saw her drop her guard at least
once after she
<br>went into bimbo mode. Brit, she was brave, and she was one hell of
a good actress, I'll
<br>give her that."
<br>&nbsp;"Cass, it's an interesting story, but what does it have to do
with anything?"
<br>&nbsp;"Because I know where she went, when she left. I know that she
really did think her
<br>mother was somewhere in California, because her father hadn't told
her, but I also know
<br>that where she did go, she didn't go to die. Brit took her boots, and
when she took them, I
<br>knew that she was getting out of here, out of her cheerleader persona.
No one even realised
<br>what the boots meant. Idiots. She’s walking on this earth, Brit is.
And I wondered, because
<br>she was so like Daria, and Molly’s middle name is Vivianne…"
<br>&nbsp;“Enticing. So..."
<br>&nbsp;“I suggest that we find her. I think that Brittany Taylor, as
we knew her, is dead. But
<br>I think the girl that was born to that name is here, somewhere. Someone
must know
<br><i>something</i> about what happened to her.”
<br>&nbsp;“You are getting <i>way</i> too carried away, Cass.” Jane shook
her head. “It’s a
<br>convincing story, and I will say I didn’t know Brittany too well, but
I don’t believe she
<br>was capable of that. No one is.”
<br>&nbsp;“Like you say, J., you didn’t know Brittany.” Cassie stubbed
out her cigarette in an
<br>ashtray. “Ignore me if you want. No one believes me. I know what they
did to her in that
<br>asylum, I do. But no one cares.”
<br>&nbsp;Jane shrugged, and continued painting. Cassie was a little weird,
but, hey, she
<br>didn’t mind Jane’s paint fumes or loud music, and what more can you
ask for in a
<br>roommate?
<br>&nbsp;*****
<br>&nbsp;“We’ve just signed a big band. A <i>really</i> big band.” said
Daria.
<br>&nbsp;Jane looked up from one of her paintings. “Oh?” she inquired.
<br>&nbsp;“What would you say to Sonic Youth?”
<br>&nbsp;They were standing in Jane’s dorm room, which reeked of turpentine
and cigarettes.
<br>&nbsp;“Um, change the name? But seriously, you signed <i>Sonic Youth?!?</i>”
<br>&nbsp;“Oh yeah. Dinner’s on me.”
<br>&nbsp;“Wow! You’ve got a babysitter for Molly, too?” Jane shrugged
on a woolly black
<br>coat.
<br>&nbsp;“No. Trent said he’d watch her.”
<br>&nbsp;They went out the door.
<br>&nbsp;“So you <i>still</i> haven’t found a place yet? It’s been four
weeks.”
<br>&nbsp;“I know. But it’s so hard when you’re in New York. I don’t want
to blow my
<br>budget, but I don’t want to live in a hovel either. And I make a <i>lot</i>
of money, believe me.”
<br>&nbsp;“How much?”
<br>&nbsp;“That’s none of your business…” Their voices echoed down the
hall.
<br>&nbsp;*****
<br><i>&nbsp;Deep in a dark warehouse, two men in military uniforms spoke
in hushed tones.</i>
<br><i>The younger and taller of them sighed, then walked away. He picked
up the cell phone</i>
<br><i>he'd left in a shadowed crevice as soon as the other man was gone.</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;He dialed a number: 0151 709 5264</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;"Could you connect me to Director St. Maris? Thank you," he
spoke into the</i>
<br><i>phone.</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;The voice on the other end of the line came through, and he
spoke once more.</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;"Chief? It's Lorenzo. No, we've got the President, but he's
not with him. Bush</i>
<br><i>will be fine, there was no major torture or anything of the sort.
Yeah. We'll be en route</i>
<br><i>to Washington tomorrow. Yes, I know, tell St. Maris we tried, but
the guard shot himself</i>
<br><i>before we could get a word out of him. The Kremlin, definitely.
See you Monday."</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;Without further ado, the man called Lorenzo hung up the phone,
exited the</i>
<br><i>building, and entered the waiting helicopter.</i>
<p><b>Part Four (A Overview Of The New Government)</b>
<br>&nbsp;<i>An excerpt from Elitist Russia Files on the United States,
dated February 2002</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;Written by A. Baron</i>
<br>&nbsp;Since the destruction of the USA's Executive and most of its
Legislative branches of
<br>government, much has changed, but little affects the average American.
The CIA now runs
<br>the country, with an elite group of members left over from the fall
of the Senate
<br>compromising the Board.
<br>&nbsp;The Board's chairman is the CIA's president, a very young man,
not yet 22, named
<br>John Ansley. No one knows if that is his real name, but after his predecessor,
an incredibly
<br>wealthy and corrupt man named Rudy Armsworth, was assassinated, Ansley,
a young
<br>agent, rose to power in a <i>coup d'etat</i> of fantastic proportions.
<br>&nbsp;Armsworth was assassinated the same day that George W. Bush,
the newly sworn-
<br>in President of the United States, was kidnapped by unknown terrorists,
on February 1st,
<br>2001. While no civilians are aware of the fact that these were actually
Russian Communist
<br>forces, the CIA has confirmed this. We, a militant Communist factor
called the Elite
<br>Fighters, had annexed most of Siberia by early January, and we invaded
Russia's major
<br>cities and installed ourselves as the new government on January 21st.
<br>&nbsp;However, our agents failed to take over the United States as
they had planned. The
<br>House of Representatives was taken hostage and flown to our POW outpost
in a remote
<br>area of Siberia, along with much of the Senate. The President was flown
to an unknown
<br>location.
<br>&nbsp;With the country in chaos, a keen Ansley named the CIA as the
governing force, and
<br>gathered the shreds of the USA back together to form a functional,
if not exactly
<br>democratic, government. Most Americans consider Ansley a hero. The
country still runs
<br>much as it did before, though now only the Board and their designated
subordinates can
<br>pass laws. All states have ratified the new government.
<br>&nbsp;The conflict between Elitist Russia and the United States is
currently at a stalemate.
<br>The United States, with its new government and enhanced military, definitely
has the upper
<br>hand. However, there is an government, unknown to the CIA, backing
us, that may or may
<br>not be a force to reckoned with as far as the US is concerned. While,
over a year later, the
<br>two countries have not made a truce or any sort of agreement, any fighting
is at a standstill
<br>and no threats have been made. Unlike during the Cold War in the second
half of the 20th
<br>century, Elitist Russia is not in a position to fund any war, nuclear
or not. Our officials are
<br>more concerned with the Russian people, who, unfortunately, are suffering
due to the
<br>awkward and badly planned governing system. However, with one minor
incident between
<br>the two countries, with Russia being in the wrong, the USA would easily
engage in combat.
<br>&nbsp;On the weekend of June 23-24, 2001, Ansley&nbsp; was captured
by our forces, and he is
<br>being held hostage. We had thought that without him the government
would fall, but we
<br>have since decided that continued efforts to control the USA are fruitless.
A woman named
<br>Annalise St. Maris took control of the chairmanship, though she did
not appear in public
<br>until mid-September, apparently because she was out of the country.
Little is known about
<br>Annalise St. Maris, except that she is the CIA's Director, an undefined
position. It is
<br>possible that this is a token title and a cover for something else.
<br>&nbsp;While we were interested in Ansley, we are now more intrigued
by the director. On
<br>January 30th, 2002, the CIA's forces recaptured George W. Bush, though
they have yet to
<br>find Ansley. However, the government is run far more agilely and efficiently
under St.
<br>Maris, and she has easily dealt with many disputes and problems since
her appointment as
<br>a temporary chairman.
<br>&nbsp;It has been ascertained that Annalise St. Maris is not her real
name. The real
<br>Annalise St. Maris seems to have been about the same age, but she died
in a New York
<br>subway accident over two years ago.
<p><i>&nbsp; Elitist Russia File on Annalise St. Maris, updated February
12, 2002</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;Compiled by A. Baron, R. Gormanoff, and C. Feng</i>
<br>&nbsp;<b>Alias</b>: Annalise Celeste St. Maris
<br>&nbsp;<b>Real Name</b>: Unknown, but is sometimes called Ani (pr. Ah-<i>nee</i>).
Some do not
<br>think this is an abbreviation for Annalise.
<br>&nbsp;<b>Stated Birthdate</b>: October 12, 1980
<br><b>&nbsp;Actual Birthdate</b>: Late 1981/ Early 1982
<br><b>&nbsp;Age</b>: about 20
<br>&nbsp;<b>Hair Colour</b>: (uncertain if natural) Honey Blonde
<br><b>&nbsp;Eye Colour</b>: Pale Blue
<br><b>&nbsp;Skin Tone</b>: Light
<br><b>&nbsp;Height</b>: 5'2" to 5'4"
<br>&nbsp;<b>Weight</b>: 110-120 lbs
<br>&nbsp;<b>Next Of Kin</b>: Unknown
<br>&nbsp;<b>Other</b>: Annalise St. Maris is the Director of the CIA.
She runs the United States
<br>and is temporary chairman of the United States Board. Her only known
allies in the CIA
<br>are Agent Lorenzo Harding and Gen. Maxwell Landigan, Chief of the US
Military. She is
<br>rumoured to have been a close acquaintance of John Ansley's, even before
his entrance to
<br>the CIA in 1999. Her reluctance to appear in public before September
13, 2001 is
<br>unexplained. As far as Elitist Russia Agents have been able to ascertain,
Annalise St.
<br>Maris did not exist before John Ansley took control of the CIA. She
is suspected to be one
<br>of the few who know the true identity of John Ansley, and what his
plans and ambitions for
<br>the CIA are. St. Maris is the only enigma in the workings of the CIA.
She was never
<br>officially a CIA agent, or any type of government agent whatsoever,
as far as we can
<br>determine. However, she is apparently wealthy, as John Ansley is. In
short, other than surface
<br>facts, Annalise St. Maris is a completely unknown factor.
<p><b>Part Five</b>
<br>&nbsp;March already. As Daria sat in a chair next to Molly's crib,
she thought about the
<br>time that had passed.
<br>&nbsp;In only three months, she'd become a foster parent to this tiny
baby girl, dropped out
<br>of college, and gotten the job of her life. PennyLane Records was signing
more bands every
<br>day, leaving labels like Geffen, Virgin, Capitol, and Warner Bros.
way behind in the dust.
<br>However, she was still stuck in the dust as far as a house went. For
all she knew, she'd be
<br>living in Trent's apartment until Molly graduated from college. Not
that the thought wasn't
<br>appealing, but still...
<br>&nbsp; Daria looked down at the baby in the crib. More and more, every
day, she thought
<br>of Molly as her own daughter. It was so dangerous. Any day now, Molly's
mother could
<br>appear and take her away. <i>Oh, God no, I couldn't bear it</i>. Where
would she go, without
<br>Molly, what would she do? God, she was already thinking about Molly
in college, Molly
<br>in grade school, Molly tomorrow, Molly later today. She was her daughter,
if not
<br>biologically.
<br>&nbsp;It angered her so. <i>How</i>, Daria thought, <i>does any woman
have a right to take back</i>
<br><i>this baby if she gave her away?</i> But she knew Molly's mother
did. It was the note. Daria
<br>knew exactly how that woman felt. She was so afraid for her daughter,
she knew that she
<br>must do what was best for Amalia. Molly. Not matter what happened to
her, she would
<br>make sure Molly was happy and safe. Both of them would.
<br>&nbsp;But she was interrupted from her reverie by Trent, who threw
open the door
<br>joyously.
<br>&nbsp;"Daria! PennyLane Records is being honored by the Chairman of
the United States
<br>Board for our innovative technology! She's going to present me, you,
and Jesse with an
<br>award in May, at the annual Technical Innovation Awards," he announced
excitedly.
<br>&nbsp;"Wow!" exclaimed Daria in surprise. Trent scooped her up in a
big hug and planted
<br>a kiss on her lips before either one of them had time to think.
<br>&nbsp;"<i>Wow</i>." said Daria a little breathlessly.
<br>&nbsp;*****
<br>&nbsp;Cassie sat on a bench outside the New York Public Library. She
lit up the cigarette
<br>and inhaled deeply. <i>Damn! Why do things like this always happen
to me?</i>, she thought.
<br>The wind blew her long, dark cherry hair into tangles. She sat there
for almost an hour.
<br>When she went home, she lit up a joint of marijuana, grabbed her boyfriend,
and mellowed
<br>out.
<br>&nbsp;When Jane came home that night she found her roommate lying on
her bed. The
<br>room smelled of smoke and ashes, and the window was open. It was freezing,
and Cassie
<br>wore only a thin tee-shirt.
<br>&nbsp;By the time the room was warm and food was on the table, Cassie
was somewhat
<br>cognizant, but she didn't really make any sense until the next morning.
<br>&nbsp;"J, girl, we've got an interesting situation on our hands. I
went to the library to
<br>research my project on art in NYC, and used the computer system there,
'cuz my internet's
<br>down for repair until tomorrow. Look what I found."
<br>&nbsp;Jane looked at the document. It seemed to be a newspaper clipping
from the
<br>previous year. Someone had scanned it in and left it for the internet
archives of that
<br>particular newspaper, <i>The Berkeley Herald</i>. It read:
<p>&nbsp;<b><i>New Art From Promising East Coast Artist&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
August 30, 2001</i></b>
<br><i>&nbsp;Tonight, the Moonview Gallery here in Berkeley, California,
is exhibiting a show</i>
<br><i>of a wonderful New York artist, Ani Armsworth. Her last show was
in February of the</i>
<br><i>this, and she has some great new material.</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;"I like her grasp of the concept and depth of color," says
Prof. Ralph Jamison of</i>
<br><i>Armsworth. "Also, she's a magnificent painter. I love those black-and-white
photos of</i>
<br><i>Amalia, where she's painted her into color and all else is monochrome."</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;Did we mention that all of this artwork is featuring her newborn
daughter,</i>
<br><i>Amalia Vivianne? Her paintings and sketches feature her baby girl,
who was born just</i>
<br><i>two months ago. It was quite a spur-of-the-moment show.</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;The artist on the show:</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;"I'm delighted that everyone is so excited about the show.
I was afraid it was too</i>
<br><i>much of a transition from my 'ROCKST*R' series, but all the people
I've seen were quite</i>
<br><i>happy about it. Amalia's timeless, but I think rock stars can get
kind of old."</i><i></i>
<p><i>&nbsp;For pictures and more information about Ani Armsworth, check
out her website</i>
<br><i>at <b>www.ani-star.com</b></i>
<p>&nbsp;"I printed out the pictures. It's Molly. She even has the grey
wool blanket." Cassie
<br>said.
<br>&nbsp;Jane shook her head in disbelief. "My god. It's eerie. Well,
at least we know Molly
<br>isn't Brittany's daughter."
<br>&nbsp;Cassie nodded. "How are we going to tell Daria?"
<br>&nbsp;"I don't know, Cass, I really don't know."
<br>&nbsp;*****
<br>&nbsp;<i>"Shit, Lorenzo! First your soldiers screwed up and let the
guard blow his head</i>
<br><i>off, then you decide <b>I</b> have to present this freaking award
to these PennyLane people! I</i>
<br><i>should blow <b>your</b> head off, just to see how you like it!"
Ani raged. She was in her office,</i>
<br><i>the vast room where they had last visited.</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;Lorenzo was wide-eyed with surprise. "Jesus, Ani," he said,
"Don't take it so</i>
<br><i>harsh! We're going to find Armsw-"</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;She smacked him across the mouth. Both stood still with shock.
Then she spoke in</i>
<br><i>a hush.</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;"Don't ever forget that Elitist factions invaded this country
and kidnapped our</i>
<br><i>democracy. They even made it through my husband's defenses, and
they took him too.</i>
<br><i>He's hardly even seen Amalia. Our baby. One slip, and- she may not
be there for him to</i>
<br><i>see.</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;"You just made a slip, Lorenzo. PennyLane's CEO is a girl
I knew in high school.</i>
<br><i>You should have <b>asked</b> me first. I don't know if I can fake
my way through this one. I</i>
<br><i>know that her best friend is rooming with Cassie at Julliard. Do
you realize what that</i>
<br><i>means?"</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;"Cassie... She's the one who-"</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;"The one who's been right on our trail, searching for me.
She was a friend, a</i>
<br><i>good friend, long ago, and she refuses to believe I'm dead. I'm
worried about Berkeley's</i>
<br><i>article. She's been asking about Ani Armsworth. If the Elitist agents
make the</i>
<br><i>connection-"</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;Lorenzo gulped. "Shit."</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;"Yeah."</i>
<p><b>Part Six</b>
<br>&nbsp;Molly giggled as Daria tickled her feet. She was playing with
her toys on the floor,
<br>and it was a fine May night .
<br>&nbsp;"Now, you be a good little girl for Jane, or no apple sauce tonight,
okay?" the latter
<br>said, smiling.
<br>&nbsp;"Don't worry, we'll be <i>fine</i>. I've got the window open
so the paint fumes won't
<br>bother her. I know your cell phone number, etcetera, etcetera. You
guys just go out and
<br><i>enjoy</i> yourselves," Jane said with an evil smirk.
<br>&nbsp;"Jane!" Daria yelped. Despite the fact that she had cheerfully
given up her
<br>apartment search over a month ago, Jane was still a yenta-ing the hell
out of her.
<br>&nbsp;"We'll be back by midnight," said Trent, and he whisked his girlfriend
out the door.
<br>&nbsp;Jane locked the door behind them and resumed painting. It was
a pretty ordinary
<br>night, as things went. She and Molly ate dinner, played for a while,
and then Jane tucked
<br>her sleepy charge into her crib.
<br>&nbsp;As Molly slept, Jane stood over her crib. She still hadn't told
Daria about Molly's
<br>mother, and truthfully, she didn't intend to. Not until she knew the
full story. She'd
<br>mentioned having an old friend by the name of Ani Armsworth who thought
she knew
<br>Daria, the other day, and Daria hadn't recognized the name. Yet this
Ani woman obviously
<br>knew Daria. You only had to read the note. <i>"...there is nowhere
else to go." "I know that</i>
<br><i>you, of all people, will be as good and kind to my baby as I, her
mother, would be."</i>
<br>&nbsp;Who was this Ani Armsworth? She was a complete mystery. All Jane
knew was
<br>that she was an artist, and she had given birth to a daughter, that,
if not Molly, was her
<br>identical twin or something. A total enigma.
<br>&nbsp;Come to think of it, couldn't she do some sort of check on this
Armsworth person,
<br>just to see about who she was? To find out about Molly, so that someday,
when the little
<br>girl asked, <i>"Aunt Janey, who's my real Mommy and Daddy?"</i>, she
could answer?
<br>&nbsp;Jane sat on the bed (where Molly's crib now resided next to)
and booted up Daria's
<br>computer. In a matter of minutes, she was online and reading what she
was searching for.
<br>&nbsp;<i><b>Armsworth, Amalia Vivianne</b>, born to Ani and Jonathan
Armsworth, Tuesday,</i>
<br><i>June 17, 2001, at&nbsp; the New York City Hospital, in New York,
New York.</i>
<br>&nbsp;She next performed a search on Ani and Jonathan Armsworth, guessing
that their
<br>certificate of marriage would have been from NYC as well. It took a
moment for her to
<br>realize what she was seeing.
<br>&nbsp;<b><i>B. (Ani) Louise Taylor and Jonathan Randolph Armsworth</i></b>
<br><i>&nbsp;Married November 12, 2000</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;St. Lucas's Chapel, 1245 Donahue Lane, NY, NY.</i>
<br>&nbsp;Below was more information about the bride and groom, but she
didn't need to read
<br>it. Jane already knew. Why hadn't she believed Cassie? But never mind
<i>that</i>-
<br>&nbsp;Donahue Lane was ten minutes away.
<br>&nbsp;*****
<br>&nbsp;When Daria arrived home that night Jane seemed unusually edgy,
but she didn't
<br>think much of it. Probably just jitters from being caffiene-deprived,
something that often
<br>happened to her friend. She'd done a good baby-sitting job, though.
Molly was sound
<br>asleep, something that didn't happen often.
<br>&nbsp;Quick as a wink, Jane was out the door, out of the apartment.
Daria shrugged this
<br>off, as well, inventing more excuses for her friend. What did it matter?
It was probably just
<br>some little insignificant thing...
<br>&nbsp;*****
<br>&nbsp;At 11:39 pm, Jane knocked on the office door of the church. Surprisingly,
the light
<br>had been on, and, sure enough, a man opened the door. He was a short,
round man was
<br>curly white hair, probably in his late fifties.
<br>&nbsp;"Hello, I'm Father Kirkpatrick. What can I do for you?" he said,
with a heavy Irish
<br>brogue.
<br>&nbsp;"I'm searching for an old friend, who was married here about
a year and half ago.
<br>My name is Jane Lane," she replied, extending her hand. The priest
shook it, and invited
<br>her in his office.
<br>&nbsp;"Come in. I believe we may have the records you're looking for,
though I don't
<br>know if they will have any information that will help you locate her.
What is your friend's
<br>name? Can you give me the date?" said Father Kirkpatrick.
<br>&nbsp;Jane stepped into the office and shut the door behind her. "She
was Brittany Taylor
<br>when I knew her, and she was married to Jonathan Armsworth on November
12, 2000."
<br>&nbsp;Father Kirkpatrick stepped into a back room, emerging a minute
later with a book
<br>in his hand. He flipped it open to November 12th.
<br>&nbsp;"Ah, here we go. Brittany Louise Taylor and Jonathan Randolph
Armsworth. They
<br>didn't leave any other information, but, in fact, I do remember this
couple. I had just
<br>transferred from a parish in Dublin, and I watched Father Roberts perform
the ceremony.
<br>Your friend was very young, blonde? Yes, a blonde. I remember her husband
much better,
<br>though. He was a very nice man, about a year or so older than her.
Looked a lot like that
<br>John Ansley fellow. From a parish near SoHo, he said. Of course, I
didn't question him."
<br>&nbsp;"Do you remember anything else?"
<br>&nbsp;"Actually, I do. They were moving into a house on Manhattan.
On Moore Drive. I
<br>remember that very distinctly, because the girl was very quiet, almost
silent, throughout the
<br>entire ceremony, and very distant afterword, but she did mention the
house. I was talking to
<br>her husband, and she said, 'We're moving to Moore Drive, and we've
got a house with a
<br>cupola.' She seemed very pleased about it. Apparently there aren't
any other houses with
<br>cupolas on Moore Drive."
<br>&nbsp;*****
<br>&nbsp;<i>Ani unlocked the door to her home in New York that night,
opening the door just</i>
<br><i>wide enough to slip in without out Pixie or Megan, the cats, being
able to slip out.</i>
<br><i>Sliding down onto the floor, she leaned against the door and sighed.</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;She'd been staying here since yesterday. The technology awards
were only two</i>
<br><i>days away, in Carnegie Hall, no less. She was so, so worried. They
would know her,</i>
<br><i>Trent and Daria both.</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;The phone in the hallway rang, and she answered it.</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;"Hello," she said, still sitting. "Lorenzo?"</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;A long pause stretched between "Lorenzo?" and her next words.</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;"Oh, <b>no</b>. Dear God, is he- You don't know. I'll be there
as soon as I can."</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;She hung up the phone, flung open the door, and saw Jane Lane
pulling up in her</i>
<br><i>driveway.</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;"Screw the government," she muttered. Ani shut and locked
the door, and walked</i>
<br><i>down the driveway.</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;She tapped on Jane's window. Jane promptly rolled it down.</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;"Jane? It's me, Brittany. Could you possibly give me a ride
to Washington,</i>
<br><i>D.C.?"</i>
<p><b>Part Seven</b>
<br>&nbsp;"So, how did you find me?" Brittany asked her once they were
on the road.
<br>&nbsp;"Article in a Berkeley newspaper," Jane replied. "From there,
Amalia's birth
<br>announcement in the paper, your marriage license, and Father Kirkpatrick.
He said it was
<br>the house with the cupola."
<br>&nbsp;"Good. I'm glad it wasn't Cassie. Now, I've <i>finally</i> outwitted
her. She knows about
<br>the marriage, but she wasn't able to talk to Father Kirkpatrick. Thank
god. You know where
<br>we're going, right?"
<br>&nbsp;"Yeah. I listened to the newscast on AM WETT 580, and everything
clicked.
<br>Especially when you wanted to go straight to D.C."
<br>&nbsp;"They've finally got Jonathan out of that hell. But... they didn't
say if he would be..."
<br>&nbsp;"Look, he's hung on for a year in China. Now that both China's
and Elitist Russia's
<br>governments have crashed, and he's in a nice, safe hospital, he's got
a good chance of
<br>survival, I'd say."
<br>&nbsp;"Don't you ever call a hospital safe! What he went through at
Manson-"
<br>&nbsp;"Manson wasn't a hospital. It was a freaking <i>slaughterhouse</i>.
How do you think
<br>Andrea turned out like she did?"
<br>&nbsp;"Her, too?"
<br>&nbsp;"Her mother signed her in. It was two years before her father
got custody and got
<br>her out of there. She's never been the same. Some people there did
have real problems, but
<br>most were just... different."
<br>&nbsp;"I know. Jonathan was signed in by his uncle, who wanted the
family fortune he had
<br>custody of until Jonathan's eighteenth birthday. He did have an incident
with drugs, but he
<br>was totally clean by the time I met him."
<br>&nbsp;"Was Rudy Armsworth Jonathan's uncle?"
<br>&nbsp;"Actually, no. He was his mother's cousin, and when Jonathan
got out of Manson,
<br>Rudy gave him a place to live, and later, a job. The corruption stories
had little base in the
<br>truth. Jonathan was a very good agent, to give him credit."
<br>&nbsp;"So, what is America going to know about Molly?"
<br>&nbsp;"Molly? Oh, you mean Amalia. Well, now that it's safe, I'm planning
to come clean
<br>about our identities."
<br>&nbsp;"That's all good and well, but what about Daria?"
<br>&nbsp;Brittany sighed. "Well, Jane, I figure I'll just have to tell
her, after John gets out of
<br>the hospital. I hate to do that. She's Molly's mother as much as I
am, and Daria was always
<br>the person I admired in high school. If I hadn't been in danger of
being sent back to Manson
<br>if I acted normal, we would've been friends. How <i>is</i> Amalia?"
She hastily changed the
<br>subject. "I mean, Molly, since I guess that's what we'll be calling
her now."
<br>&nbsp;"Molly is crawling all over the place. She took her first steps
a month ago, in April.
<br>She's a sweetheart." Jane smiled, thinking of the little girl.
<br>&nbsp;"I remember. I didn't officially take up my duties as chairman
until September, so I
<br>could spend time with her. She was all I had, with Jonathan gone."
<br>&nbsp;"He'll be okay."
<br>&nbsp;"I hope so."
<br>&nbsp;*****
<br>&nbsp;Two days later, word came over the television, radio, and internet
that Chairman
<br>John Ansley was going to live, and had been moved out of the ICU in
the Washington
<br>hospital where he was a patient. Fireworks were set off that night
in every town.
<br>&nbsp;In a city called New York, a man, a woman, and a baby girl called
Molly sat on a
<br>balcony and watched the fireworks' glow. With them were two other women.
Both were
<br>famous in their own ways. One was a brunette.
<br>&nbsp;The other was a blonde.
<p>&nbsp;THE END

<br>Brittany, Kevvie, etc belong to MTV, but she's protected by that Supreme
Court decision
<br>regarding dervitave content, yadda yadda yadda. But if you steal her
story, there are many
<br>other Supreme Court decisions she can list that will say exactly what
happens to YOU.
<br>(vague mention of relatives in Mafia.)
<p><b>Notes</b>: I have nothing against Communists, they were just the
people that, in this story, were
<br>the villains. Remember, communes worked fine for many people in the
sixties. I hope I
<br>didn't offend anyone, Russian, Chinese, Communist, or otherwise.

<p><b>XOXO</b>: Thanks to my friends, esp. Fangso and Pean. These two were
my inspiration for
<br>Elitist Russia, since they're militant communists factors in their
own right. Also, thanks to

you need an ego-

not!
