*not* an episode, but the best imitation of an episode that I could write.
Thanks to the creators of "Daria" for providing so much rich material for
fanfics....


This is the twelfth episode of The Driven Wild Universe.  It follows 1)
"Rose-Colored Lenses," 2) "The Tie That Chokes," 3) "That Thing You Say,"
4) "'Shipped Out," 5) "Andrea Speaks!", 6) "Cheered Down," 7) "None in the
Family, Part One," 8) "None in the Family, Part Two," 9) "Outvoted," 10)
"Of Absolute Value," and 11) "Breaking the Mold."

I'd give this a 2S...

Before I tell you to "Enjoy!", an introduction is needed.  Most of you
who've been forced to slog through inferior MTV programs on you way to
"Daria" will be familiar with "The Real World."  But just in case you've
lucked out and never caught an episode, let me give you some background.

"The Real World" claims to be a reality-based television show.  Its opening
line states: "This is the true story of seven strangers picked to live in a
house and have their lives taped.  Find out what happens when people stop
being polite."  That's it in a nutshell.  I won't give away any more
details because I want you to recognize the more ridiculous aspects of the
show (and there are so, so many) in my fanfic, except that there have been
eight "Real Worlds" to date.  New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, London,
Miami, Boston, Seattle, and Hawaii.  There is also a "Real World" spinoff
called "Road Rules," now in its sixth season I believe, in which five or
six people travel through exotic locales.

As for this fanfic, it is possibly the first one I've written that could be
called -- *GASP* -- "situation-based."  I wouldn't call it a *parody*, per
se, because it doesn't take the Daria characters and transform them into
"Real World" characters, but it *does* have some elements of parody.
Overall, I'd say that its tone closest resembles the one in "Scream."  It's
part-parody, part examination of how people are affected by the media,
*all* slamming of the "Real World" phenomenon.

Those of you who despise "The Real World" should enjoy it.  Those who
aren't too familiar with the show will probably be entertained anyway,
although to understand some of my references, you may want to first travel
down to "Points of Interest" in my postscript, where I explain them.

That said........ Enjoy!!!



Ten Spot Promo:  That annoying one where the numbers materialize in the
water, and it takes forever for the 10 to appear...


(Cue music: "Steal My Sunshine" by Len)

(Shaky cam. pan-over shot of Lawndale.  It's morning, and the rising sun
bathes every rooftop with golden light.  We lurch over houses, streets, the
park, the town, the school, until we finally circle around a noticeably
large house that takes up half the side of the street.  It's surrounded by
tennis courts, a mini-zoo, a helicopter  landing pad, a stable for the
ponies, a Olympic-sized swimming pool, and a giant fountain.)

DARIA: (offscreen voice-over)  If you haven't already turned away because
of motion-induced nausea, do not be fooled by what you see.

(The pan-over camera jerks to a stop, as does the music.  Jerk to close-up,
frontal shot of Our Heroine, staring out at us through the screen, wearing
her patented deadpan expression.  Behind her, we see that the walls appear
to be a swirl of neon green and pink.)

DARIA:  You have now entered Hell.  You will be sharing this hell with two
other unfortunate people and five morons.  But before you start your
journey, let me tell you the true story of how this all began...

SURREAL WORLD -- by Kara Wild


ACT ONE

SCENE 1 (Morgendorffer house, middle of the night)

(Shot of the outside.  Cut to close-up shot of a hollow-eyed Quinn, staring
straight ahead in a zombie-like fashion, as glowing light flickers across
her face.  Cut to wide shot.  We see that she's camped-out on the living
room sofa, curled up in a sleeping bag and wearing pajamas, a half-consumed
bowl of no-salt, no-butter, no-oil, fat-free popcorn beside her.
Offscreen, from the T.V., we hear several loud, whiny young voices.)

(Just then, in the background we see Daria walking downstairs, also in
P.J.'s.  She pauses for a moment, takes in what Quinn's watching, then
continues to walk down and over to the couch.)

DARIA:  Ah, Masterpiece Theatre.  (Bt. faux thoughtful.)  No... that one
requires you to think *and* watch at the same time.

QUINN: (edgy)  *Quiet*, Daria!!!

DARIA:  So you've been sucked into watching another "Real World" marathon,
have you?

(Pause.  Quinn continues to watch like a zombie.)

DARIA:  And how is *this* different from the one they showed last weekend?
Or the weekend before?

(Beat)

QUINN: (scornful)  *Last* weekend was the "Road Rules" marathon.  Duh!  How
could you *not* tell them apart?!

DARIA: (smirking)  I guess it's just that all whining, self-absorbed people
look alike to me, with or without  the R.V.  (Bt.)  Have *you* ever thought
of trying out?

QUINN:  Would you be *quiet*?!  This is a *very* important scene.  Puck's
about to get thrown out of the house.

DARIA:  Again?

(She comes over to the other side of the sofa and sits down beside Quinn as
we hear offscreen: )

GUY: (angry)  You're disrespecting ME, you're disrespecting the people in
this HOUSE --

GUY 2:  Whoa, dude, like *chill* out.  If you can't handle the Puck-man,
then you're, like, *toast*.  'Cause the Puck-man's only on *nine* -- you
ain't *seen* me on ten --

GUY:  Get *OUT*!!!

(Sounds of collective shouting.  Daria sighs, rolls her eyes.)

DARIA:  Doesn't someone get thrown out of the house every season?

QUINN:  Only in the *first* eight seasons.  Not the last eight.

DARIA:  How can you watch this crap?  It's the same boring stuff every
season.  Someone gets kicked out.  Someone has an incurable disease and-or
a *substance* abuse problem.  Someone comes to terms with being gay.  And
two cast members get together for some ill-advised "snuggling."

QUINN: (surprised)  Wow.  How d' you *know* so much?

DARIA:  Uh... (reddens a little)  by default.  This show is always on.
Always... always.

QUINN:  Well then you *understand* that these guys have major *problems*.
Much worse than you or I could have.  It's like watching an episode of
"Jerry Springer," but with more attractive people.

DARIA:  How very reassuring.

QUINN: (annoyed)  And at least their problems are *interesting*.  Sheesh --
I couldn't even watch *your* life for a half-hour before tuning out.

(Daria cocks an eyelid -- "Touche.")

(cut to: )

SCENE 2 (Lawndale High, a few days later)

(Shot of the outside.  Cut to shot of Daria, Jane, and company sitting in
class.  Suddenly, from offscreen: )

MS. LI: (over the P.A.)  Attention all students.  I'm pleased to announce
that a veeeeery exciting opportunity has befallen the school.  Something
that will have us rolling in *fame* and glory and lots and lots and *lots*
of much-needed *spending* money!   Ooh-*hoo*, I'm so *exited*!  Ooh,
hoo-hoo-hoo...!

(Daria and Jane remain impassive.)

MS. LI:  Uh, erm... that said, would the *following* students pleeeease
report to my office immediately.  Jodie Landon, Jamie White, Kevin
Thompson, Daria Morgendorffer --

(Daria cocks a wary eyelid.)

MS. LI:  -- Charles Ruttheimer, Tiffany Blum-Deckler, and Saaaaaandra Griffin.

(Cut to shot of Quinn sitting in class with Stacy and Tiffany.  Quinn looks
nervous as Tiffany starts to stand up.)

QUINN:  You and S-Sandi?  What could she want with *both* of you??

(Cut to shot of Daria in class.  She gives Jane one last wary glance before
shrugging her shoulders and standing up to leave.)

(cut to: )

SCENE 3 (Li's office, a short time later)

(Shot of the outside.  We see Daria walking slowly toward the door.  Cut to
inside shot: all of the other students have already arrived.  Sandi and
Tiffany are busy discussing which is the best split-end resistant shampoo.
Upchuck is combing his hair and growling softly with lust.  Kevin is
spiking his football into the floor over and over again.  Jamie sits there
hunched over, looking rather vulnerable without the other two J's flanking
him.  Jodie is looking probingly at a man sitting with Ms. Li at her desk.
Finally Daria walks in.)

JODIE: (turning, seeing her)  Daria.  Over here.

(She scoots to one side of her chair to make room.  Daria sits down.)

DARIA:  What's this about?

MS. LI:  Oooh, I'm *glad* you asked, Ms. Morgendorffer!  I have here an
*important* guest who will explaaaaaain to you all the *glorious*
opportunity that awaits you.

SANDI: (tossing her hair)  *Great*, but could you, like, make it *fast*?
This is cutting into my *mirror* time.

KEVIN:  Yeah -- an' Brit gets jealous if I'm away from her for more 'n two
minutes.

DARIA: (deadpan)  Funny: I would think she'd be cheering with relief.

(Kevin scratches his head, looks confused.)

MAN: (dripping with enthusiasm)  Oh-ho, that's a *good* one!  Such *biting*
wit -- that's why I *chose* you.  I chose *all* of you.

(All of the students turn to stare at the man, who is thirty-something,
wearing a suit with a pink shirt underneath and a string tie.  He's got
several clunky gold rings on his fingers, and he smiles snakily.)

DARIA: (cocking an eyelid)  For *what*, exactly?

MS. LI:  For a chance to *bond* with each other as you've *never* bonded
before!

SANDI: (cringing, eyeing Upchuck)  *Bonding*??

TIFFANY:  Ewwwww...

UPCHUCK: (rubbing his hands together)  Grrrrrrrrr... sounds *promising* Ms. Li.

MS. LI:  Yeeeees.  I got the inspiration this past weekend during a certain
*delightfully* addictive marathon.

MAN:  And then she called me!  Hi, I'm Skip Wilkinson -- producer of such
memorable television fare as "Child Beauty Queens: American Sweethearts,"
and "When Postal Workers Attack."  (holds out his hand.  no one shakes it.)
Erm... anyway, Ms. Li and I came up with a proposal -- how'd you kids like
to *live* together for three fun-filled weeks?  Sharing bedrooms,
bathrooms, the kitchen --

DARIA/SANDI/TIFFANY:  No!

SKIP:  Wait-wait-wait... there's more!

(Daria suddenly gets a look of realization.)

DARIA:  This marathon you saw... would that happen to be "The *Real World*"
marathon?

MS. LI: (nervous)  Wh-What makes you say *that*??

DARIA:  Just a hunch.

SANDI: (perking up)  We're gonna be on "The *Real World*"???

TIFFANY:  Ooooooooh!

KEVIN: (jumping up)  Aw *right*!!  Girls *love* the bad boys on that show.
Like Puck an' that Neil guy -- (spikes his football -- it flies up and hits
him in the face.)  *Ooph*!

SANDI: (to Tiffany)  Like, people on "The *Real World*" become famous an'
stuff.  We could, like, end up as *models*.

DARIA: (sardonic)  Yeah -- role models for our sick sad generation.

(Sandi turns her eyes toward Daria and frowns darkly.  Daria doesn't notice.)

MS. LI: (irritated)  Would you all *stop*!  This is *not* "The Real World."
It's compleeeeeetely different.

SKIP:  Right.  "The Real World" is a bunch of twenty-something year-old
*actors* posing as regular people, living lives that are impossibly
luxurious, but *still* finding time to whine about it!

MS. LI:  Whereas you'll be just an *ordinary* bunch of normal teenagers
living together and learning about each other's lives.

DARIA:  With a few cameras lying around.

SKIP:  Eh-heh-heh-ho!  (waves at Daria to "shut up.")  What better way to
chart your progress than to have it on film??

MS. LI:  And of course we'll be *showing* the completed work to a feeeew
people.

(Daria cocks a wary eyelid.)

KEVIN: (to Skip)  So, like, why d' you pick *us*, bro?  Was it 'cause of
our (flexes his muscles, flashes a toothy grin.) *reputations*?

UPCHUCK: Our unbelievable way with the opposite sex?  Grrrrrrr...

SKIP:  No, no!  You're just a random group of students chosen randomly!
There's no sort of "master plan" involved.  (does the finger-wiggle.)  But
how fortunate we were to select such a wonderful *range* of students.
(stands up, strolls over to Kevin.)  We have our popular jock and
all-around-good-guy in Kevin.  (pats him firmly on the back.)

KEVIN:  Ow!

SKIP: (walking over to Sandi)  Our cool, suave, popular girl who wraps the
men around her finger...

(Sandi smirks, obviously finding no fault with his description.)

SKIP:  The *minorities*!  (gestures at Tiffany and Jodie.)  Tiffany: the
Chinese girl adopted by Jewish American parents, torn between two worlds,
in search of her identity.

TIFFANY: (blasé)  Uh-huh.

SKIP:  And Jodie: the tough but smart African American ready to *take* on a
white man's world!

(Jodie smiles thinly.  Skip then walks over to Upchuck, who's tapping his
fingers together in anticipation.)

SKIP:  Every group needs an *oddball*!

(Upchuck frowns.  Skip turns to Daria.)

SKIP:  *And* a brain with a take-no-prisoners attitude!

(Daria cocks an eyelid.  Skip walks over to Jamie, who's been quiet this
whole time.)

SKIP:  And you... we-ell... (long Pause)  we sensed latent homosexual
tendencies in you.

JAMIE:  *Huh*??

SKIP:  Well that about *sums* it up.  (goes back to the desk, sits down.
opens a briefcase.)  Now if you'd *all* be kind enough to sign some
*contracts*.

DARIA:  And if we exercise our freedom of will by *not* signing?

MS. LI: (faux pleasant)  Then you can spend those three weeks in your own
home.  Expelled.

(cut to: )

SCENE 4 (Pizza King, after school)

(Shot of the outside.  Cut to shot of Daria and Jane sitting in one of the
booths with a pie between them.  Daria's not eating - she's slumped-over
and looking tired.)

DARIA:  This is all just a dream.  A hideous, sick dream.

JANE: (sardonic)  Say that enough times, and maybe you'll wake up back in
Kansas.

DARIA: (frowning at her)  This *has* to be a dream - 'cause for some
reason, this whole set-up seems painfully familiar.

JANE:  Aw, "The Real World" does that to you.  Predictable plotlines,
saccharine emotions... every season is like an assault on the brain.  (Bt.
embarrassed)  Not that I would know, of course, as I never, *ever* watch
the show.

DARIA: (sarcastic)  I'm convinced.

JANE:  Anyway, it should be fun!  Just imagine: you'll get to share close
quarters with people you hate and learn *all* their twisted secrets that
you can use against them on a future occasion.

DARIA:  Your optimism is having no effect.

JANE:  You'll have cameras following you everywhere, recording your every
move, bringing to light the *true* Daria Morgendorffer in all her sarcastic
glory.

DARIA:  You wouldn't be so enthusiastic if it were *you* stuck doing this.
It's all just to buy the school more security measures.  And frankly, I
never thought our honorable principle could stoop so low.

JANE: (sympathetic)  Yeah -- selling the footage to a local cable access
channel.  I'll admit that's pretty out there.

DARIA:  You don't suppose people will watch it, do you?

JANE: (shrugging)  Hey, the Gupty's marriage therapy show became a success,
didn't it?  Besides, there's so much bland vanilla crap on the air these
days, this dabble in voyeurism should be gobbled up like jalepeno chile.

DARIA: (sarcastic)  How encouraging.  (suddenly sees Jodie coming toward
them.  Jane waves at her to sit down.)  And *you* -- to think you knew
about this all along.

JODIE: (sitting down)  Yeah?  So what?

DARIA:  So you're participating anyway.

JODIE: (philosophical)  Hey, look: I figure this is one of those rare
opportunities to give black people a face on T.V. beyond the U.P.N. network.

DARIA:  Point taken.

JODIE:  And it would give us teens from different peer groups the chance to
show we really *can* get along.

(Beat)

DARIA: (cocking an eyelid)  Get along, you say?  (Bt)  I wasn't certain,
but now I know for sure -- Ms. Li's planted a mind-control device in your
head.

(Jodie rolls her eyes good-naturedly.  Meanwhile, cut to shot of Quinn,
Tiffany, and Stacy sitting at another booth, a cheeseless pizza between
them that only Stacy is eating.  Quinn looks as despondent as Daria.)

QUINN:  It's bad enough my weird *cousin's* gonna be on the show, but I
*can't*  believe they chose *Sandi* for the vixen role over *me*.

TIFFANY: (yes-man)  That is soooo *wrong*.

QUINN:  *I'm* a "Real World" expert *too*, you know.

TIFFANY:  Yeah.

(Beat)

QUINN: (suddenly nervous)  Um, Tiffany?  Um... I hope when you're living
with Sandi and all those other people, you don't forget who your *real*
friends are.

STACY:  Yeah -- we can come visit you, can't we?

TIFFANY:  Sure.

QUINN:  And um... be sure to remember who put you where you are today.

TIFFANY:  Sandi?

(Beat)

QUINN: (irritation creeping in)  No.  (Bt)  I mean the one who's *kept* you
there.  The one who put her *reputation* on the line so *you* could have
some responsibility -- only to completely *wreck* everything so she became
the laughing stock of the *town*.

TIFFANY:  Oh yeah.
[*] see "Of Absolute Value"

(Quinn looks at her beseechingly a few seconds longer, but Tiffany doesn't
seem to get it.  Finally Quinn presses a hand to her forehead, groans, and
shakes her head.  Stacy watches her with concern.)

(fade-out.  fade-in to: )

SCENE 5 (the following week -- start of the experiment)

(Cue music: "Steal My Sunshine" by Len)

(Herky-jerky overhead shot of the neighborhood.  Zero in and circle around
the big house we saw in the prologue.  Cut to inside shot.  The students
are standing, luggage in hand, with Skip and Ms. Li.  The downstairs area
where they have gathered looks like that of a palace.  It's *huge*, and
brightly colored in swirly pastels and neon shades.  From floor to ceiling
there are bay windows, although there's no bay to look out onto, as well as
several exotic plants and birds.)

SKIP:  So what do you think of *Casa* de Lawndale??

SANDI:  Oh, I think I could feel at *home*, here.

UPCHUCK:  It'd make the perfect lovenest for the Chuckmeister.  Grrrrrrr...

JODIE:  How did you get this place?

SKIP:  Oh, the owners were *thrilled* to lend it out for educational purposes.

DARIA:  And for a hefty sum and loads of publicity.

MS. LI:  Ms. *Morgendorffer*!  (Bt)  May I remind you that Big Brother is
*watching*.  (points up to a camera on the ceiling, which seems to be
recording them.)

(Daria flinches, as does Jodie.  The other students eye the camera with
interest.)

SKIP:  Now let me direct you all to the Pepsi room, where you'll find a few
little amenities...

(Cut to shot of the inside of a large rec room with several Pepsi logos
prominently displayed.  Everyone walks in, looks around.  In the corner, we
see a sectioned-off space.)

SKIP:  This is your basic recreational room.  Couch, T.V. --

JODIE:  What's *that*?  (points to the space.)

KEVIN:  Heeeeeeey -- the *make-out* room!  Brit'll really go for that.

SANDI:  No, you dummy, it's a *confessional*.  A mainstay of the "Real
World" *and* "Road Rules."  You use it to confess your *innermost* thoughts
and feelings.

DARIA: (deadpan)  Assuming you've got any.

(Beat.  Jodie can't contain a chuckle.  Sandi frowns at them.)

SKIP:  Confessional??  No, no!  We *respect* our copyright infringement
laws.  This is a "*share* box."  See how it's got Sherry the share pillow
in there?  *Right* on top of that nice mirror.

DARIA:  With the glowing red recording light.

SKIP & MS. LI:  Mrrrrrrrr...

DARIA: (to Jodie)  A great place to spontaneously assert your true
emotions.  And check which is your better side.

SKIP: (overhearing. annoyed)  Do you have anything *more* you'd like to
add, Daria??

(Beat)

DARIA:  Well... only a question.  If we're just supposed to be a bunch of
*real* teenagers living together, then why does our house resemble the
inside of a Vegas casino?

(Skip and Ms. Li look at each other and shake their heads, as if they can't
believe she'd ask such a silly question.)

MS. LI:  *Because*, Ms. Morgendorffer...

SKIP:  People can't watch you kids in a *regular* house!  It would be
*much* too boring.

DARIA:  But by putting us in the Taj Mahal, aren't you distorting reality
even *more* than you already have by forcing us to live together in the
first place?

SKIP:  *Distorting* reality??  (big laugh.)  Heavens, *no*!  We're merely
*enhancing* it to make it more *digestible* to the average viewer.  That
way, they can get *much* more out of it than if...

DARIA: (sardonic)  It were really real?

SKIP:  Ummm...  (frowns at her.)  Nevermind.  (Bt)  Come on, everyone: our
next stop will be the Microsoft digital kitchen...

(Pause)

DARIA: (offscreen voice-over)  So that's how it started...

(Cut to frontal close-up of her in the "share box.")

DARIA:  An ordeal in which I was, and am still, forced to spend each waking
moment with people I don't know and don't really wish to know...

(cut to: )

SCENE 6 (montage of scenes)

(Cue music: "Crazy" by Britney Spears)

(Herky-jerky shot of sun rising over Lawndale.  Cut to herky-jerky shot of
the house from the outside.  Cut to shot of Sandi, Tiffany, Jodie, and
Daria standing in front of a huge bathroom counter and mirror, fit for a
palace.  The counter and floor are made of green marble, and in the
background, we see a waterfall running down the wall, across the floor.
Sandi and Tiffany have their make-up spread over practically two-thirds of
the counter, crowding out Daria and Jodie.  Both look as though they've
been grooming themselves for quite some time, while Daria still looks
morning-scruffy and is brushing her teeth.  Jodie's brushing her hair.)

SANDI: (frowning)  The automatic faucets aren't *working* again.  I don't
know *how* they expect us to survive under these conditions.

JODIE:  So you do it by hand.  So what?

(Sandi rolls her eyes, then glances at Tiffany.)

TIFFANY: (as if Jodie were from Mars)  We might chip a *nail*.

JODIE: (rolling her eyes)  Right.  How could I forget?

DARIA: (sardonic)  And to think there are people who have to get by without
running water *or* thickening nail polish.

SANDI: (glaring at her)  Like, are you accusing us of *complaining*??  (Bt)
Excuse *me*, we haven't complained about *anything* since we got here.  Not
even about how you two got the *larger* room, although we *could* have.

TIFFANY:  Yeah.

JODIE: (annoyed)  We don't have the larger room.  It just has an extra window.

TIFFANY: (cringing)  Stuffy rooms are *bad* for the skin.

SANDI: (tossing her hair)  And it's important to look your *best* --
especially when it's likely someone might be *watching* you.  (eyes trail
toward the wall camera, then dart back.)

DARIA: (deadpan)  Yes -- dazzling a stalker is one of the most important
parts of a girl's day.

(Beat)

SANDI: (frowning)  All I'm *saying* is that you never know when a *talent*
agent might be randomly flipping through the channels and *catch* one of us
on Channel Sixy-four.

DARIA:  That's if he's not too busy arranging contracts for his *real* clients.

(Jodie chuckles softly.  Sandi frowns harder, unable to come up with a
satisfactory response.)

DARIA:  Since I don't quite have *your* zeal for seeking attention, I think
I'll take my chances with anonymity.

SANDI:  Fine.

(Cut to close-up of Sandi in the share box with her arms folded.  Cue
music: "You Oughtta Know" by Alanis Morissette.)

SANDI:  You know, sometimes I think that *girl* with the glasses is making
*fun* of me.  It like um... (pauses to think.)  fills me with pain inside
that I, like, can't *express*... an' stuff.  (Bt)  She's just like *Ruthie*
from "Real World: Hawaii."  Well you know what?  No one *liked* Ruthie.
Ruthie *left*.  (Pause.  mumble.)  Well *actually*... she came back, and
then no one liked *Amaya*, or whatever --

(Pounding heard offscreen.)

SANDI: (pissed)  Dammit, I've still got *five* minutes in the confessional!
(Pause.  looks into the camera.)  So which d' you think is my better side?

(Pause.  We then hear Daria utter a sigh from offscreen.  Cue music:
"Building a Mystery" by Sarah MacLachlan.)

DARIA: (offscreen voice-over)  Well now that I've got the confessional
back, where was I?

(Cut to side shot of Daria walking down the stairs.  Kevin slides past her
down the bannister, surfer style.)

DARIA: (offscreen voice-over)  Oh yeah.  I've spent every waking moment
being recorded for the purpose of a quick buck.

(We hear Kevin crash offscreen.  Daria flinches only slightly, then
continues walking downstairs.)

(Cut to frontal shot of Daria walking down the street to school, a
full-fledged camera crew behind her and a microphone dangling overhead.)

DARIA: (offscreen voice-over)  Having to endure the constant scorn of
less-than-understanding classmates.

(From offscreen, a tomato whizzes in Daria's direction, hits her on the
face, and bounces off.  Daria scarcely bats an eye.  The tomato is followed
by more vegetables, coming at her from both directions.  Cut to side shot.
We see students standing on the sidelines, shouting, waving their arms,
trying to get in front of the camera.)

STUDENT:  Take your exploitation crap to another town!

STUDENT 2:  Quit *misrepresenting* the Lawndale High student body!

BARRY:  You're giving nerds *everywhere* a bad image!

(He tosses an animal pelt at Daria.  Daria freezes as it flies past, then
shudders and walks on.)

DARIA: (offscreen voice-over)  *Or* having to endure the star-struck frenzy
that has gripped the *rest* of the student body...

(Cut to shot of Daria walking into O'Neill's class, tomato juice running
down her face and broccoli in her hair.  She makes her way past Jodie, who
looks similarly disheveled, and slides into her seat.  We see that the
classroom looks a little more *crowded* than usual, and that many people in
the back of the room are edging their way forward, waving.)

DARIA: (to O' Neill.  deadpan)  Um, could I have a few extra seats for
*them*?  (gestures off to the side.  pan over to show the camera crew in
the doorway.)

(Cut to shot of O'Neill at the front of the room.)

O'NEILL: (gestures and voice exaggerated)  Of *course* you can, o' favorite
pupil of mine!

(Resume shot of Daria.  Jane leans toward her.)

JANE: (wicked smirk)  Need some help washing off the stardust??

(Daria looks at Jane with an annoyed "Et tu, Brute?" expression.  She sighs
heavily.)

(Cue music: "Livin' La Vida Loca" by Ricky Martin.  Cut to shot of the
outside of a nightclub with a long line of young people wrapping around it.
The large sign flashes in neon: Lawndale Sizzling Hot Nites.)

DARIA: (offscreen voice-over)  Then at night, having to work with my
housemates in our co-owned, co-run nightclub which *Skip* thought would be
the perfect place for teenagers to learn real world work habits...

(Cut to shot of Daria standing at the bar, polishing a glass [we presume
she's not serving drinks, but who knows!].  Offscreen we hear a heavy beat
along with the obnoxious lyrics of the Ricky Martin song.  Herky-jerky
pan-over reveals a room crowded with people dancing, while lights swirl all
around.  The camera jerks to a stop over Kevin and Brittany.  Cut to
close-up.)

KEVIN:  Babe, I'm tellin' ya, *no* girl in that house even comes *close* to
you.

BRITTANY:  Aww, Kevvy...  (gets into her jealousy mode.)  Well they'd
*better* not!  Or else I'll just have to get *even* with you for being a
*two*-timer!  (Pause.  sees Kevin looking offscreen with an aroused look on
his face.)  Kevvy?

KEVIN:  Who-hoooo... check out *Sandi*.

(Cut to herky-jerky shot of Sandi dancing with Jamie, *both* of whom look
like they're pretty into it.  Resume shot of Kevin and Brittany.  Brittany
slaps him across the face, storms off.)

(Cut to shot of Daria.  A bouncer comes up to her.)

BOUNCER:  Yo, Daria: want me to eject that clown?

(He points offscreen.  Jerky pan-over to Upchuck, whom we see getting in
the middle of two couples, taking the unwilling women aside, and dancing
with them simultaneously.  Resume shot of Daria.)

DARIA:  Sure.  But don't let him know your orders came from me.  (Bt)  On
second thought, *do*.

BOUNCER:  Gotcha.

(Cut to shot of Upchuck.  The bouncer appears, grips his arm, and drags him
kicking and protesting away.)

(Cut to shot of Daria in the share box, looking weary.  Cue music:
"Building a Mystery" by Sarah McLachlan.)

DARIA:  Overall, I've had to endure three days of my privacy being
plundered like never before.  I'm starting to wonder what this constant
stream of attention will turn me and my housemates into.  And all I can say
is --

(She's interrupted by a crashing sound.  In the background, we see Kevin
and Brittany fall into the share box, making out passionately.)

BRITTANY:  *Neat-o* make-out room, Kevvy!

KEVIN:  What'd I tell ya, babe??

(Daria at first looks startled.  Then she groans.)

DARIA:  It's gonna be a *long* three weeks.



****************
END OF ACT ONE

[Shot of Daria and Quinn watching the "Real World."]


***You are now entering commercial *HELL*.  Please keep your seatbelt
securely fastened.  You are about to see some of the lamest commercials put
on television.***

1)  "Next Wednesday, on the Ten Spot: Daria's cousin Erin gets thigh sweats
for Trent, and now she's in hot pursuit... and threatening to turn the
Morgendorffers' lives upside down.  Catch it next week on an all-new
'Daria.'"

In the spirit of the episode, I've decided to make all of my commercials
for stupid MTV programs...

2)  On the next "Real World":  Someone goes skinny-dipping!  Someone nearly
drinks herself to death!  Two cast members declare their undying love for
each other... then hop into bed!  And that's just in the *first* episode!!!
Be there to watch the sh** hit the fan on "Road Rules: Hawaii"!  Oops, I
mean "The Real World."  Damn things seem so much alike...

3)  On the next "Fanatic": "Hi, I'm Suzy Lou from Madison, Wisconsin, and I
get to meet... *Tom Green*!  WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!  I, like, think he's
the *greatest* comedian on the face of the earth.  When he licked the butt
of that cow, he inspired me to be a better person.  When he surprised that
old lady by jumping out of a corner dressed in a vampire costume, he
inspired me to try hard *every* day and never give up on my dreams!
(Pause)  No, MTV is *not* paying me to say this!  I'm not an actress, I'm,
like, a *real* person.  (Pause)  Really!  Just because MTV made us fans
audition first..."

***You are now leaving commercial *HELL*. Aren't you happy you survived?***


ACT TWO

SCENE 1 (continuation of the previous scene)

(Shot of the inside of the share box.  Offscreen, we hear heavy sounds of
making out, and occasionally see elbows popping up.  Finally Kevin and
Brittany sit up, lean against a wall as they continue to make out.)

BRITTANY: (extracting herself just long enough to say: )  This share pillow
is *really* great to lean on, Kevvy!

KEVIN:  Cool, babe.

(They resume making out.)

(cut to: )

SCENE 2 (morning, a day or two later)

(Cue music: "Every Morning" by Sugar Ray.)

(Shot of the sun rising.  Shaky pan-over of the town, then the
neighborhood.  We see people mowing lawns, picking up newspapers, riding
their bicycles.  Zero in on the house.  Cut to shot of Sandi staggering
into the bathroom, looking bed-rumpled, obviously unaware that she's being
filmed.  Herky-jerky cut to shot of Tiffany.  She's lying in bed, and the
lump next to her reveals that she's not alone.)

(Cut to shaky shot of pancakes sizzling in a frying pan.  Zoom out to
reveal that the chef is Jodie.  She's standing over a stove that looks as
though it could double as the control panel of a spaceship.  To her left is
a gigantic refridgerator with magnets on it that are suspiciously shaped
like the Microsoft logo.  Behind her, in the middle of the kitchen, is a
long, white-tiled counter.  Daria is sitting there, eating cereal and
looking rumpled and tired.)

JODIE:  Where were you earlier?

DARIA:  Unburdening my soul to the multitude.

JODIE: (amused)  You mean you've finally embraced the concept of the share box?

DARIA:  No, but it's one of the few rooms in this house where I can be by
myself.  Theoretically speaking.

JODIE:  C' *mon*, Daria, the people here aren't so bad.

DARIA:  They're not so *good*, either.

JODIE:  All right, I won't argue with you about Sandi.  Seeing her at
student council meetings is bad enough.  But the rest --

(She's interrupted by Kevin waltzing in.  He opens up the fridge, takes out
a carton of milk, then opens it and guzzles it down so that half of it
pours onto his shirt.  He then drops the carton on the ground and stomps it
flat.)

KEVIN:  Yeeeeeeeeeeah!  I'm *bad* to the bone!!  (to Daria and Jodie.)
You'd better watch out for the *Kev-man*!  This is me on *niiiiiiiine* --
you ain't *seen* me on... uh... (sees Jodie's cold expression.)

JODIE: (no-nonsense)  Pick that up.

(Beat)

KEVIN:  Hmmm, okay.  (picks up the carton, leaves quickly.)

(Daria give Jodie a look that says, "I rest my case."  Jodie sighs heavily.)

JODIE: (philosophical)  Well hey, look on the bright side: you may see the
less-attractive parts of people's personalities, but you also get to see
their sweet side.  (Bt.  smiles)  You know, you do this cute little snore
when you're asleep.

DARIA: (reddening)  Do *not*.

(Cut to a shot obviously taken sometime during the night, of Daria doing
just that.  Resume present shot.)

DARIA:  But while we're on the subject, (smirks wickedly) I had no idea you
were such a big Celine Dion fan.

(Jodie turns red.  Cut to flashback shot of Jodie getting dressed that
morning.  She's bopping around and singing - you guessed it - the Titanic
song.  Resume present shot.)

JODIE:  Well... we've all got our quirks, myself included.  (Bt)  But
seriously: didn't writing that article for Lowdown make you more interested
in learning about people's insides?

(Daria gets a slightly subdued look, remembering some of the reactions she
got during her last round of survey-taking. [See "Breaking the Mold."])

DARIA:  To be honest, I think I got a little *too* close for comfort.
Besides, how likely are we to see our housemates' innermost thoughts?
We're on television.

(She glances over her shoulder -- pan over to show a camera that's
practically in her face.  Cut to shot taken from that camera's P.O.V.
Daria's back is to us in the foreground, and we can see Jodie in the
background.)

JODIE:  So?

DARIA:  So... has it escaped you that because we're being filmed, our
housemates aren't acting quite *natural*?

JODIE:  Besides a little posing for the camera, I don't see any change.

DARIA:  But that posing for the camera makes all the difference.  That's
about all each cast on "The Real World" ever does...

(As she speaks, the camera slowly veers away from Daria and focuses on
Kevin, who has been standing in the corner, holding the flattened milk
carton over a garbage can.  The garbage can is automatic: every time Kevin
holds the milk carton close, grinders in the can start to whirl.  Knowing
that the camera's on him, Kevin now plays a game where he holds the carton
close, then pulls it away last-minute.  Once in a while, he looks directly
at the camera and winks.)

DARIA: (offscreen)  ...  All of their emotions are heightened.  Each of
their trivial, stupid conflicts gets blown into a crisis.  Tears are shed.
Cast members veer between giving pretentious speeches about the emptiness
in their souls to stabbing each other in the back.

JODIE: (offscreen)  Wow.  You sure know a lot about "The Real World."

DARIA: (embarrassed)  Umm...

(Finally the garbage can snatches Kevin's milk carton and turns it into pulp.)

KEVIN:  Aw, *man*!

(The cameraman, obviously disappointed that Kevin's show is over, steers
the camera back toward Daria and Jodie.)

DARIA:  My point is that in spite of his legal concerns, Skip *wants* us be
like the people on that show.  He wants us to exaggerate our behavior to
outrageous levels, because what better way to market us to the cable
network?  We'd be "the peep show you don't want to miss" -- the perfect
trap to ensnare guillible teen viewers.  Who, in turn, would become
guillible teen *consumers* of the products they advertise during commercial
breaks.

JODIE:  Hmmm, maybe so... but what makes you so sure we *will* act that
way?  Those people *audition* to be on the show.  Skip picked us.  Yeah,
maybe he had a plan in mind when he did, but that doesn't mean we have to
*follow* it.

DARIA:  You may want to run that idea past our starstricken housemates.

JODIE:  C' mon, you're always so cynical.  Why not wait out the three
weeks, and I bet you'll find that this experience was *nothing* like "The
Real World."

(Just then, we see Sandi come in, with Jamie pursuing her.  Sandi is still
in her pajamas, but is now evidently groomed.  Jamie's hair mussed up and
his shirt is off, revealing prepubescent pecs.)

JAMIE:  Aw c' *mon*, Sandi!  Don't tell me last night didn't mean anything!

(Sandi eyes him with some irritation and discomfort.  Daria looks at Jodie
with a "Could I be any *more* correct?" expression.  Jodie pretends not to
see.  Just then, Kevin waltzes onscreen and slaps Jamie on the back.)

KEVIN:  Hey-heeeeeeey!  Way to *go*, Jasmine, my bro!!

(Cue music: "Beautiful Stranger" by Madonna.  Cut to frontal shot of Kevin
in the share box.  He spikes his football and does the chicken dance.)

KEVIN:  Wha-hooo!  Wha-hoooooooo!!  *Jasmine* and *Sandi*!
Way-to-gooooooo!  I'm the Q.B.!  Whoo-hoooo!

(Cut to flashback scene of earlier that morning -- Sandi and Jamie are
lying in Sandi's bed.  Sandi is propped up on one elbow, and seems to be
looking at something offscreen, while Jamie looks at her like a lovesick
puppy.)

SANDI:  I don't know... maybe it's this being young and trying to *find* my
identity in, like, this *fast*-changing world, or whatever.  But for some
reason, I've been, like, totally turned *on* to you these past couple of
days.

JAMIE:  Me, too!

SANDI:  So... d' you think I'd look good posing on the beach with, like,
*Ananda* introducing MTV videos?

JAMIE:  Ohhhh yeah.

(Cut to shot of Jamie in the share box.)

JAMIE:  I've never met a girl like Sandi.  She makes me feel even better
than that girl I *used* to like.  (Pause)  And I am *not* gay.

(Cut to the present shot of Sandi, Jamie, Daria, Jodie, and Kevin in the
kitchen.  Sandi gets a somewhat pitying look on her face.)

SANDI:  Look Jerome, you're a nice guy and all, but what happened was,
like, a *one*-night impulse thing, understand?

(Jamie seems to not get her meaning for a few seconds.  Then it sinks in,
and he nods slowly.  Daria cocks an eyelid, while Jodie frowns at Sandi
with deep irritation.)

DARIA: (deadpan)  I'd say you came through loud and clear.

(Sandi picks up on the hidden meaning of her words and frowns at Daria.)

SANDI:  Like, *who* asked you??

DARIA:  Excuse me?

SANDI:  You're, like, always being some big *know-it all* about stuff, and
it's, like, *really* annoying.

JODIE: (irritated)  Annoying??   You're one to --

(Just then, Tiffany walks into the kitchen, pursued by Upchuck.)

UPCHUCK:  Tiffany, my sweet: don't tell me last night didn't *mean* anything!

TIFFANY:  Ewwwwwwwww.

(Everyone else in the room gets a stunned expression on their face.)

(cut to: )

SCENE 3 (montage of scenes throughout the week)

(Cue music: "Prisoner" by 311)

(Herky-jerky pan-over shot of the outside of the house, at night)

DARIA: (offscreen voice-over)  Well after that little display, I was
convinced that my assumptions had been confirmed...

(Cut to frontal close-up of her in the share box, wearing a deadpan
expression.)

DARIA: But somehow, what Jodie said about the surveys taking me closer to
people's insides, and that we weren't the cast of "The Real World" got me
thinking.  Maybe it was because I was starving for more interaction with my
Partner in Crime.  Or because the unnaturally bright lighting in this house
was causing me to have a seizure...

(Cut to overhead shot of Daria in the shower with the water running.  We
see her face -- she seems lost in thought -- but the steam from the water
conceals any... um... unmentionables.)

DARIA: (offscreen voice-over)  Or maybe it was because I'm going soft.  But
somehow, a part of me did not recoil at the idea of getting to know my
housemates as human beings.  At long last, I decided that if I had to be
stuck with them in this pathetic experience, I may as well see if they're
capable of acting humane.

(Cut to shaky shot of Daria standing by the doorway of the Pepsi room,
leaning against a wall, with her arms folded.  A camera man crouches beside
her, his camera aimed toward activity offscreen.  Every few seconds, he and
Daria eye each other warily.)

DARIA: (offscreen voice-over)  So I've decided to observe.

(Cut to shot of Sandi and Tiffany sitting on the couch, unaware of Daria's
presence.  Sandi is doing Tiffany's nails.)

SANDI: (sober)  Now Tiffany, tell me *exactly* what happened to lead you to
the bed of Charles *Ruttheimer*.

(Pause.  Tiffany goes noticeably pale and looks as though she would rather
not say anything.)

TIFFANY:  Uhhhh... well...

SANDI: (patting her hand)  Don't be shy, Tiffany.  This is *Sandi* you're
talking to, remember?  Not some *wacked-out* loser weirdo.

(Pause.  Tiffany still looks reluctant, but finally: )

TIFFANY:  Um... you were, like, asleep... and there was an icky spider on
my pillow...

SANDI: (cringing slightly)  *Ugh*.  (Bt)  Like, a *really* icky one?

TIFFANY: (also cringing)  Yeah.  (Bt)  And Upchuck... he... and I... and
he... and um...

(Sandi raises her hands for her to stop talking.)

SANDI:  *Say* no more... I understand *everything* now.  He, like, got you
with the old *spider* maneuver, didn't he??  (shakes her head,
sympathetic.)  I've seen it before, and have *almost* fallen victim to it
myself once or twice.  When you're weak with fear from seeing something
*gross*, the guy takes *advantage* of you.

TIFFANY: (nodding gratefully)  *Yeah*.

SANDI: (frowning a tad)  Someone *obviously* didn't do a good enough
teaching you how to *watch* out for that stuff.  (Bt)  But don't worry: *I*
will.

(Tiffany continues to nod, looking even more relieved... for her.  Cut to
shaky shot of Daria by the door.  She's got a reflective look on her face,
as though she's mulling over the sincerity of Sandi and Tiffany's exchange.
Just then, Upchuck bursts through the door, wearing a typical Tigerman
expression.  He taps his fingers, rolls his tongue.)

UPCHUCK:  *So*, Tiffany my sweet, have we gotten over our little
*inhibitions*? ?  Realized that the Chuckster is --

SANDI: (sheilding Tiffany)  You stay *AWAY* from her!!!

(Tiffany shrinks back against the couch, looking a bit faint.)

UPCHUCK:  Oh come *on*, Tiffany, I wasn't *that* bad, was I??  *Yooou*
certainly weren't *lacking*.  Grrrrrrrrrrr...

SANDI: (horrified)  You're *not* saying you and she *did* it --?

TIFFANY:  EWWWWWW!!!  Nooooooooo!

(Upchuck turns red at her reaction, realizing it was a mistake to
exaggerate the events that took place the night before.  Sandi turns a
megabitch glare on him.)

SANDI:  Like, why don't you make like *David* in "Real World: Los Angeles"
and get *lost*?!

(Upchuck chuckles a bit, trying to come up with a response.)

(Cut to close-up shot of him in the share box.)

UPCHUCK: (exaggerated remorse)  Rejected... *no* woman's ever rejected the
*Chuckster* before.  (Pause)  Or at least none that I'd actually succeeded
in talking into my bed before -- and *believe* me, she wasn't the *first*!
No way, *ohhhh* no!  (cringes)  It, like, fills my poor tender body with
*unspeakable* PAIN!

(He turns around, starts to undo his pants.)

UPCHUCK:  I mean *what* woman could resist firm flesh like *this*??

(He lowers his pants.  The screen suddenly goes black and the word
"CENSORED" flashes across it.)

(Resume shot of Upchuck, Sandi, and Tiffany in the present.  Upchuck has
recovered and is tapping his fingers together with anticipation.)

UPCHUCK:  Give it *time*, Tiffany my love.  Yoooou'll come around -- if
someone *else* doesn't get to me first!  Grrrrrrrrrrr...


SANDI:  In your *dreams*, jerk.

(Offscreen, we hear a groan.  Sandi, Tiffany, and Upchuck turn their heads.
Cut to shaky shot of Daria, in time to see her roll her eyes with disgust
and leave the room.  Resume previous shot.  Sandi frowns after her, as does
Tiffany.)

UPCHUCK:  Perhaps, my dear Sandi, *she* doesn't agree with you...

(Cue music: "Who Will Save Your Soul?" by Jewel)

(Cut to shot of Daria sitting in her room with Jodie.  Jodie is at a large
desk, on top of which we see a blanket of papers, books, and folders that
seem to pertain to all kinds of school-related activities.   She's working
diligently, but with a frown, and she seems noticeably edgy.  Daria,
meanwhile, is sitting on her bed, the Collected Works of Jonathan Swift in
hand.  She appears to be reading, but is actually observing Jodie over the
edge of her book.  We see a large camera in one corner of the room, red
light glowing away, and a microphone dangling overhead.  Finally, after
several seconds, Jodie slams down her pencil.)

JODIE:  Where is that *music* coming from??!

(Daria looks a tad startled by her vehemence.  Then she shrugs.)

DARIA:  Beats me.  It was here when we arrived.

JODIE:  Well it's driving me *crazy*.  (With that, the Jewel song comes to
an abrupt halt.)  How am I supposed to *work* on this stupid crap with it
playing all the time??

(She groans loudly and picks up her pencil.  Daria cocks an eyelid,
startled by her vehemence.  After several seconds pass:)

DARIA:  I suppose I should tell you that I took your adv--

JODIE:  Not *now*, Daria, all right??  (Bt)  The whole *stupid* school is
depending upon me to have this done tomorrow!

(She gets back to work.  Daria gets an "O-kaaay" expression on her face,
looks as though she'd like to say something more.  But finally, after
several more seconds, she quietly slips off the bed and leaves the room.)

(Re-cue music: "Who Will Save Your Soul?")

(Cut to shot of Daria sitting at the kitchen counter, trying to read her
book.  Suddenly a bunch of strangers walk past her.  They seem to be mostly
male, some high school age, some older.  Daria lays down her book.)

DARIA:  Who're *you*??

(The people get guilty, anxious looks on their faces.  They glance at each
other, then at Daria, then at each other again.  Finally one guy tries to
explain.)

GUY:  Uh... we're friends of--uh...

(Meanwhile the other people are turned toward the cameras and waving and
smiling.)

DARIA: (deadpan)  Say no more.  Head down the hall to the Pepsi room.
There, you'll find other gatecrashing teens pretending to be friends of the
house members, but who are really hoping to snare a lucky break by having
their faces appear on a T.V. screen.

GROUP:  *Cool*!!

(They flock in the direction of the Pepsi room.  Suddenly Daria sees
someone she recognizes.)

DARIA:  Jesse???

(He stops.  Yes, it's *that* Jesse.)

JESSE:  Um... I-uh... like, recording artist exposure stuff.  Um... *don't*
tell Trent.  (he leaves quickly.)

(Daria watches him go, then rolls her eyes.  A few seconds later, from
offscreen: )

KEVIN: (offscreen)  Hey, Daria!  Check *this* out!

(Suddenly his football flies onscreen and knocks Daria's book off the
counter.  She watches it fall to the floor with a stunned expression, then
turns to glare at Kevin.  Cut to shot of Kevin and Brittany on the other
side of the room.  Kevin pumps a fist.)

KEVIN:  *Yeeeeeeah*!  Bullseye, babe!  How's that for your bad dude??

BRITTANY:  That was neat-o, Kevvy!  Gooooooooooo *Kevin*!

(She does a cartwheel across the floor and stops just short of one of the
cameras.  Cut to shaky shot of Daria.  She presses her forehead to the
counter.  fade-out)

(Fade-in to shaky shot of Daria trudging down the hallway, near the Pepsi
room.  She's just about to walk past the door when Jamie comes out, wearing
a glum expression.  They both stop, look at each other.  Suddenly we hear
Sandi's laugh coming from inside, along with that of some of the
gatecrashing males.  Jamie gets an even more bleak expression.  Daria
frowns a tad, understanding the cause of his frustration, and looks as
though she's going to speak.  But then, Jamie turns and heads in the
direction from which she came.  Daria watches him go.  Pause)

DARIA: (offscreen voice-over)  I've observed for a week, now, and I've yet
to see anything approaching community in this house.  Each time a new bond
is formed, it gets ripped apart.  Each day doles out new misery for one or
more house members.  We live in factions, never talking to anyone from a
different faction.  And then there's another problem...

(After watching Jamie go, Daria turns and walks in the opposite direction
-- and almost runs right smack into a camera.  Her eyes widen and she steps
back, then shudders a little.  Then she frowns.)

(Fade-in to shot of Daria, later that night, in the bathroom.  She lays a
washcloth over the lens of one camera, then climbs into the shower.  Starts
to take off her bathrobe, when she notices something on the nozzle.  Cut to
Daria's POV -- the nozzle has a tiny glowing red light.  Cut to a shot
taken from an overhead angle  -- the same angle of Daria we saw earlier in
Act Two.  This time, she's staring at the camera lens with a glaring
expression.  We then see her reach off to the side, offscreen, and grab
something.  She shakes her arm, then points a can of shaving cream at the
camera.  Squirts.  We see a stream of white foam, and then the screen goes
black.)

(Fade-in to shot of Daria under the covers, at night.  Suddenly she lifts
the covers and peaks out.  She then frowns and sits up.  Pan over to reveal
a camera, practically in her face.  Daria stares at the camera for several
seconds, before reaching forward and flicking on the lens cap.  No sooner
does she do that then the cameraman removes it.  Daria wilts, but continues
her staredown with the camera -- she refuses to let it get the better of
her.  Cut to close-up of the camera lens -- a soulless, unyeilding black
circle with a glowing recording light.  Cut to close-up of Daria.  She
groans and finally lets herself fall backward against her pillow.

SCENE 4 (Lawndale High, a few days later)

(Shot of the outside.)

SKIP: (offscreen voice-over)  This experiment is going *fabulously*!

(Cut to shot of him sitting with Ms. Li in her office.)

SKIP:  I can see it all coming together -- tempers are starting to *fray*,
ill-advised love affairs are starting to go *awry*!  Pretty soon this house
will be a *tinderbox* waiting for the right match!

MS. LI:  Ooooooh *excellent*.  SUQZ will by *dyyyyying* to buy this up!

SKIP:  *Dying*??  They've already gone to *heaven*!  Not only has *this*
season been bought up, but *next* season, too!  Not to mention our new
experimental "Classroom On the *Road*."  I've *already* got students
auditioning!

MS. LI:  Oooh-hooo!  *Oooh*!  That's *more* money in the bank than I could
ever dreeeam of!  You are a *genius*, Skip.

SKIP: (doing the "right back atcha" finger point)  No, *you're* the genius
for hiring me, Angela!

MS. LI:  And you got the parents to *bug* off -- even the pushy, insistent,
self-riiiiiiighteous, always wanting to have their *own* way ones!

SKIP:  Hey, nothing like the promise of a little litigation work headed
their way.  (exaggerated wink.)

MS. LI:  I *knew* my car got sideswiped by the *right* person.

SKIP:  And with the profits on this baby covering the cost of repairs, I'm
*only* going to ask for *forty* percent as my share.

(Ms. Li stops smirking.  Her eyes narrow.)

(cut to: )

SCENE 5 (auditorium, at that same time)

(Shot of the outside.  We hear the chants of protesting students -- the
same ones harassing Daria in Act One.)

STUDENTS: (chanting)  What do we want??
For-you-to-take-your-*degrading*-portrayal-of-student-culture-and-your-invasive-
means-of-revealing-our-lives-to-*another*-city!  When do we want it??  NOW!

(Cut inside the auditorium.  There are long, loooong lines of students
waiting to audition.  One line reveals Quinn, Stacy, and the remaining two
J's.  Quinn is frowning and talking on a cell phone, while the others
twitch nervously and eye their competition.)

STACY: (watching one girl trudge by)  Wow, she's pretty *and* she plays
three different sports.  And co-founded the suicide hotline!

JOEY:  I guess they didn't think she was interesting enough.

STACY: (faint sounds of hyperventilating)  Oh gosh... I hope I can make in
on!  I hear "Class Land 2" gets to run a clothing boutique *and* take a
trip to Monaco!

JEFFY:  *And* they've got a built-in movie deal.

JOEY/JEFFY/STACY:  Ooooooh!

QUINN: (irritated)  Guys, keep it *down*!  (returns to her phone call.)
What do you *mean* you watched "Fashion Fusion" with *Sandi*??  I thought
*we* were s'posed to watch it together.

TIFFANY: (from the receiver)  I forgot to call you.

QUINN: (not buying it)  You forgot?  Ohhh *sure*, you forgot.  (Bt)  And I
s'pose you also *forgot* to call and invite me over every *other* day these
past two weeks?!

TIFFANY:  Umm...

QUINN: (curt)  Nevermind.  Why don't you just *go* off and play with Sandi
in your *freaking* mansion since you obviously like *her* so much.  (hangs
up the phone.)

(Pause.  We see that Stacy's been watching Quinn, a subdued expression on
her face.)

STACY: (hesitant)  Um, Quinn...

QUINN: (turning to her, tossing up her hands)  I *can't* believe it, Stacy!
I can't believe she'd *betray* us like that.

STACY:  Quinn, don't you think that maybe you're rushing to judg--?

QUINN: (not paying attention.  reflective)  Maybe what she needs is for
someone to drop by and remind her of her Fashion Club duties.  (Bt)  Y'
know I really *should* pay Tiffany a *visit* one of these days...

(cut to: )

SCENE 5 (back at the house)

(Cue music: "Someday" by Sugar Ray)

(Herky-jerky pan-over of the outside.  We see several people sitting
around, including Daria and Jane on the edge of the roof.  Cut to shaky
shot of them.  Daria's looking as weary as ever, while Jane looks
sympathetic.  Over Jane's head we see the words "Daria's Friend" in
squiggly white writing, with an arrow pointing to her.)

JANE:  So you never struck gold in your quest for realness, huh?

DARIA: (deadpan)  Not even fool's gold.  I'd say my suspicions have been
handily confirmed.  Thanks to the wonders of television, the people in my
house are quarrelsome, reckless, back-biting posers who are about as real
as a supermodel's breasts.  If MTV saw us, they'd call our show "Real
World: the Next Generation."

(Jane cringes, peers downward.  Cut to shot of Sandi, Tiffany, and Upchuck
seated by the outdoor pool.  Sandi and Tiffany are sunbathing, and several
gatecrashing males are helping out by adjusting their umbrellas or rubbing
suntan lotion on them.  Upchuck, meanwhile, is lying on his stomach,
getting a massage from two girls [he's obviously gotten over Tiffany].
Offscreen, we hear the sounds of tennis being played.  Suddenly a tennis
ball whizzes onscreen and knocks the suntan lotion out of one of the guys'
hands.)

KEVIN: (offscreen)  *Yeeeeeeeah*!  I'm one *bad* dude!

SANDI:  *KEVIN*!!!  (sits up straight, glares offscreen.)  Would you *cut*
it OUT?!  Skip, like, said you're s'posed to be the *good* guy -- not the
obnoxious *loser* who no one *likes*!!

(Beat)

KEVIN: (offscreen)  Ohhhhhh.  Gotcha!

(Resume shot of Daria and Jane.)

JANE:  Hmm... I think see what you mean.

DARIA:  The constant exposure is even getting to *me*.  I haven't been
*nearly* as sarcastic as I usually am.

JANE:  Yeah.  You just missed the perfect opportunity to mock Kevin.

DARIA: (weary)  I've been so inundated with his stupidity, it's not even
worth it.  What's more, I keep finding myself unable to relax -- to make
mistakes, to scratch myself in places no one has a right to see -- out of
fear that it will find its way on tape.  It's eaten away at my natural
responses and turned my into a nervous, bitter wreck.

JANE: (sardonic)  And I guess if you tried to vent your hostility by
sending everyone to a violent, bloody death, you'd risk getting caught on
tape.  (Bt.  cocks a brow)  Unless you did it from up here.

(Daria shakes her head and points upward.  Cut to shot from their P.O.V. --
we see a helicopter hovering noiselessly overhead, a camera extending from
it.  That's where all of the herky-jerky pan-overs have been coming from.
Resume previous shot.  Jane looks up at it, bursts out laughing with
amusement and embarrassment, and waves.  Daria remains impassive.)

JANE:  *Whoops*... I wondered where that breeze was coming from.

DARIA: (sarcastic)  And I can tell you're really upset about it.

JANE: (shrugging)  Well let's put it this way: while I'd never want the
claustrophobic life of a starlet, I *do* sort of envy you guys in your
opportunity to present all sides of yourselves -- even if no one takes it.
Sometimes I feel like all anyone ever sees is happy-go-lucky Jane, without
knowing the *twisted*, tormented soul that lurks within.

DARIA:  Then maybe *you* would have coped better with this experience.

JANE: (shrugging again)  Maybe.  But at least you have Jodie as your isle
of normalcy.

(Daria cocks an eyelid.  Cut to flashback shot of Jodie and Daria in the
kitchen that morning.  Daria's reading at the counter, while Jodie's
cooking.  Suddenly Jodie flings down the spatula so hard, it nearly knocks
her pan onto the ground.)

JODIE;  *Stupid* kitchen.  I can't work *anything* in here!

(Resume present shot of Daria and Jane.)

DARIA:  Guess again.  Let's just say that *Jodie's* feeling the strain of
constant surveillance as well.  (Bt)  But you know what really concerns me?

JANE:  What?

(Beat)

DARIA: (more subdued)  What if this behavior *isn't* the result of people
being watched?  What if this is how they *always* behave when they're
alone??

JANE:  So that means what you've always believed when you heckled them at
school is true.  So what?

DARIA: (weary)  Yeah -- so what??  (Pause)  Only that I never really wanted
to get close enough to see if it *was* true.  I was happy with my
ignorance, because it kept me from plunging into despair.  But now...

JANE: (sympathetic)  Hey... a three-week experience under the strangest of
circumstances can't teach you *that* much about the other members of your
species.

DARIA:  Maybe not.  But what I can safely say is that I'm stuck with a
deepening mystery -- of where the posers leave off and the *real*
personalities begin.  (groans)  And it's *getting* to me.  (Bt.  glances
downward.)  And no one's done a more expert job at obscuring reality than
*Sandi*.

(Cut to shot of Sandi, Tiffany, and Upchuck as before.  We see Jamie creep
over to Sandi, crouch down beside her.)

JAMIE:  Um... Sandi.  We, um, have to talk.

(Sandi looks up at him, gets a slightly embarrassed look on her face.)

SANDI:  Josh, I've, like, *said* all that needs to be said.

JAMIE:  Actually, my name's --

SANDI:  Look, I told you that you're a nice guy, and stuff, but it was
*one* night.

JAMIE: (getting a morose expression on his face)  It wasn't one night to
*me*, Sandi.  It was... my, um... my...

(Sandi catches his meaning and reddens a little.)

SANDI:  Oh.  I... (Pause)  I-I didn't know.  (long Pause.  vaguely
apologetic)  Look... like I said, I wasn't thinking straight, and
*besides*, directors *like* bedroom scenes, so I thought --

JAMIE:  Huh???

SANDI:  Um, nothing.  (Bt)  Listen, I've got *two* dates tonight at the
nightclub, but how'd you like to be my emergency *back-up* in case the
others *cancel*?

(Pause.  Jamie finally nods.  After several more seconds, he finally gets
up and leaves.  Meanwhile, cut to shot of Jane and Daria.  The helicopter
microphone has picked up the dialogue, so they've overheard the exchange.
Jane is frowning darkly.)

JANE: (sarcastic)  Ah yes, the mystery is when that girl ever *stops*
posing.  User of men, smearer of good names... our little Sandi is just
*full* of ways to get attention.  (Bt.  smirks wickedly)  In fact, I feel
like giving her some *right* now.  (calling out)  Yoo-hoo... Sandi!!

(She waves down at her.  Cut to shot of Sandi on the ground.  She looks up,
then turns scarlet.  Cut to shot from her P.O.V.  We see Jane waving, an
exaggerated smile on her face, and Daria smirking beside her.)

JANE:  Remember *me*??  It's Jane Lane!  Remember?  Your *pal* JANE...
LANE!  It's great to see you!  Gosh, *when* did we last see each other??
It's slipped my mind...

(Resume shot of Sandi.  She does a wave, mumbles some sort of greeting,
then tries to ignore Jane.  Cut to shot of Jane and Daria on the roof.
Jane now smirks with satisfaction.)

JANE:  I *so* love tormenting that girl.  (Bt)  Now *that's* the kind of
fun you should be having with this experience.

DARIA:  Think she'll ever be embarrassed enough to apologize to you?
[*] see "Outvoted"

JANE: (shrugging)  Who knows??  But seriously -- if you're gonna be on
T.V., and you feel like the world's turned upside down and people aren't
being real, one thing you could do is let *yourself* go crazy.

DARIA: (disbelief)  You want *me* to act like *them*??

JANE:  No.  But what I'm saying is that you're going to be influencing
hundreds of impressionable young minds with this T.V. program of yours...
why not take the opportunity to *mess* with their headsa little?

(Daria pauses to absorb what Jane said.  Then she smirks.  fade-out.)

(fade-in to: )

SCENE 6 (house, the next evening)

(Cue music: "Adia" by  Sarah McLachlan)

(Herky-jerky shot of the outside of the house.)

DARIA: (offscreen voice-over)  So I decided to take Jane's advice.  But I
soon learned that  messing with all of your wonderful minds wasn't as easy
as I thought it would be...

(Cut to shaky shot of Daria at the kitchen counter, looking through several
sheets of paper with a mild frown of concentration on her face.  Every so
often, she reaches for a nearby plate of celery sticks topped with peanut
butter and takes a bite.)

DARIA: (offscreen voice-over)  Perusal of my contract revealed that it's
air-tight.  No messing with the camera lenses. No torching the house *or*
the share box. (Bt)  No pumping anti-establishment recordings into the
sound system, including Beatnik poetry, white supremacist mottos --

(Daria looks up from the papers.)

DARIA:  There go those KKK slogans I wanted to try.  (long Pause.  looks at
the camera)  That was a *joke*.

(She resumes looking at the papers.)

DARIA: (continuing offscreen voice-over) or any music by an artist with a
sharp utensil for a first name.  No alcohol.  No drugs.  No smoking.  No
rapping.  No rapping while smoking.  No hitting someone with a closed fist
-- although hitting someone with an *open* hand is permissable as long as
it's done in the heat of anger.  That is also the only time you can refer
to someone as a "bitch" or a "ho."

(Daria sighs heavily and chomps down hard on a celery stick.)

DARIA: (offscreen voice-over)  Anyway, the list goes on, and I still hadn't
reached the end of the preamble.  (Bt)  Oh, and did I forget to mention
that this is supposed to be a television show based on our natural behavior?

(Just then, we see Sandi walk into the kitchen. She at first seems to not
notice Daria, as she's heading toward the back pantry.)

DARIA: (offscreen voice-over)  I was beginning to think that I was out of
luck -- until fate stepped in...

(Sandi stops abruptly, and turns to look at the jar of peanut butter
sitting on the counter.  She walks back over to Daria and stands across
from her, on the other side of the counter.  Picks up the jar, looks at it
with some disbelief, then frowns at Daria.)

SANDI:  Like, *excuse* me, what do you think you're *doing* with that??

DARIA: (deadpan)  I'm using it as superglue to create the ultimate food
sculpture.  (Bt)  Or ingesting it.  I haven't decided.

SANDI: (frowning)  Look cousin of that
girl-I-*hate*-so-much-I-can't-even-say-her-*name*-right-now, that's *my*
peanut butter.

DARIA: (glancing at her plate of celery sticks)  Oh.  Sorry.  If you feel
my unpopular essence has tainted it, I think Jodie has another jar stashed
away somewhere.

SANDI: (rolling her eyes with disgust)  I can't, like, *use* a common
supermarket *variety* -- mine is *organically* grown.  (points to the
label.)

DARIA: (looking)  Oh.  (Bt)  So do all organically-grown foods have no flavor?

SANDI: (losing her temper)  It's not for *eating*, it's for *rubbing* over
your skin!

DARIA:  And would there be any organically-grown jelly to go with that?

SANDI:  Your skin *absorbs* the nutrients and gets an afterglow.  God, you,
like, know *nothing* about skin care treatments!

(Beat)

DARIA: (cocking an eyelid)  Wearing peanut butter... no, I'm afraid I don't
have the guts to test out *that* fashion statement.  My gut is only made
for one thing. (pats her stomach.)  And if you don't mind my saying so, I
think the peanut butter has gone to a better place.

(Pause.  Sandi frowns darkly at Daria.)

SANDI:  You just, like, think everything's *so* funny, don't you??

DARIA: (deadpan)  I didn't realize I was laughing.

SANDI:  You've been, like, making *fun* of us this whole time.  You're just
a... a *bully*.

DARIA: (stunned)  *Excuse* me??

(Sandi leans in closer to her.)

SANDI:  You *heard* what I said -- and you know what??  I am *fed* up with
it.  Eating my peanut butter without permission and then making fun of me
was the *last* straw.  (Bt)  I'm calling a house meeting.

(She pulls back, turns away, and leaves.  Pause.  Daria turns and looks at
the camera, wearing an "O-kaaay" expression on her face.)

DARIA: (offscreen voice-over)  Just when I thought I couldn't do any
damage, I found that I'd messed with *someone's* mind.  Sandi is apparently
convinced that I'm out to get her.  Or at least she's pretending to be
convinced.  Either way, my life has taken a definite turn toward the
surreal.


****************
END OF ACT TWO

[Shot of Kevin dropping the milk carton and stomping it flat, while Daria
and Jodie look on.]


***You are now entering commercial *HELL*.  Please keep your seatbelt
securely fastened.  You are about to see some of the lamest commercials put
on television.***

1)  On the next "Tom Green Show": Watch Tom try to make Suzy Lou of
Wisconsin pretend to be an exotic dancer for a local businessmen's banquet.
Then watch him create the ultimate spit glob -- and chuck it at customers
coming out of a supermarket!  Oh the laughter and good times!

2)  On the next "Celebrity Death Match": Watch the characters from
"Undressed" get down and dirty!!!  Then watch Celine Dion battle Deon
Sanders to see WHO has the right to bear the name "Dion"!  (Pause)  Yeah,
we *know* they spell their names differently!  But hey, look... MTV's
greenlighted us for three more seasons, and we have to come up with
matchups *somehow*!

3) On the next "Total Request Live": Will 'N Sync's latest succeed in
knocking Brittany Spears's latest out of first place??  What will The
Backstreet Boys say when we talk to them *live*  and *in person*??!  You
won't wanna miss it!!!

***You are now leaving commercial *HELL*. Aren't you happy you survived?***


ACT THREE

SCENE 1 (later that night)

(Cue music: "The Last Stop" by the Dave Matthews Band)

(Shot of the outside of the house.)

JODIE: (offscreen voice-over)  She called you a *what*?!

(Cut to shaky shot of Sandi and Tiffany in their room.)

SANDI: (sober)  A *bully*.  (Bt)  Like, haven't you noticed how she's
always saying *mean* things to everyone??

TIFFANY:  Yeah.

SANDI: (eyes narrowing)  I'll bet anything that *Quinn* put her up to it.

TIFFANY:  That's soooo *wrong*.

SANDI:  Ever since the *very* beginning she's been on my case.  Our first
meeting with Skip --

(Cut to grainy black-and-white flashback shot of Daria, Sandi, and the rest
of the students in Ms. Li's office.)

DARIA: (slo-mo)  Yeah -- role models for our sick sad generation.

SANDI: (present offscreen voice-over)  Or when we were all in front of the
*mirror* --

(Cut to grainy black-and-white shot of Sandi, Tiffany, Jodie, and Daria in
the bathroom.)

DARIA: (slo-mo)  Since I don't quite have *your* zeal for seeking attention...

SANDI: (present offscreen voice-over)  Or that morning after I spent the
night with Jermaine --

(Cut to grainy black-and-white shot of Sandi, Jamie, Jodie, Daria, and
Kevin in the kitchen.)

DARIA: (slo-mo)  I'd say you came through loud and clear.

SANDI: (present offscreen voice-over)  And when she and her *friend* were
making fun of me on the roof --

(Cut to grainy black-and-white shot from Sandi's P.O.V. of Jane waving and
Daria smirking.)

SANDI: (present offscreen voice-over)  And now *this*.  I'm telling you,
Tiffany: she's, like, getting out of *control*.

TIFFANY:  Yeah.

(Cut to frontal close-up of Tiffany in the share box.)

TIFFANY:  Quinn's cousin is soooooo wrong.  (long Pause)  Is it true the
camera adds ten pounds?

(Cut to shaky overhead shot of Daria and Jodie in their room.)

JODIE: (disbelief)  You *ate* her peanut butter??

DARIA:  Either that, or some really tasty candle wax.

(Jodie shakes her head.)

JODIE:  *That's* what got her upset??  But she uses *my* stuff all the time
without permission.  (Bt.  sounding bitter)  All she wants is an audience.

(Cut to frontal close-up of Jodie in the share box.)

JODIE:  Sandi's gone too far -- what Daria did was an *accident*.  She's
just looking for an excuse to turn on the waterworks in front of the
camera.  And after what she didto *Jane* in the election, and the nasty
attitude she's shown around here, I can't keep it to myself anymore.  (Bt)
Somebody's got to teach her a lesson.

(Cut to frontal close-up of Jane in the share box.)

JANE:  *Wha-hooooooo*!  I've always *wanted* to be in one of these things!!
(Bt)  Um, I mean... (sobers up) I've known Daria a long time, and she's not
the type to intentionally upset someone... (mumble) unless urged on by a
friend.  (Bt)  That would require actually giving a damn about that person
in the first place.

(Cut to shaky shot of Daria and Sandi in front of the bathroom mirror that
same night.  Sandi's washing her face, Daria's brushing her teeth.  Both
keep eyeing each other somewhat warily.)

(Cut to frontal close-up of Kevin in the share box.)

KEVIN:  Y' know, 'cause I'm the good guy an' all, it's hard for me to take
sides.  But *man*, I gotta go with Sandi on this one...

(Cut to shot of the half-eaten jar of peanut butter.  Zoom in for a close-up.)

KEVIN: (offscreen voice-over)  I mean this is peanut butter, dudes.
*Peanut butter*!

(Cut to frontal close-up of Upchuck in the share box.)

UPCHUCK:  Grrrrr... two luscious ladies.  Why must the Chuckster choose
*one* over the other??  (Bt)  But Daria *did* have that bouncer throw me
out...

(Cut to grainy black-and-white shot of the bouncer dragging Upchuck out of
Lawndale Sizzling Hot Nites.)

(Cut to frontal close-up of Jamie in the share box.)

JAMIE:  I really, um, wanna not like Sandi after the way she's been
treating me.  (Pause.  wilts)  Aww, but I *can't*...

(He gets a depressed look on his face.  fade-out.)

(fade-in to: )

SCENE 2 (house meeting, the next evening)

(Cue music: "One Way Or Another" by Blondie)

(Shaky shot of the outside.)

DARIA: (offscreen voice-over)  Before I knew it, D-Day had arrived.  I
could immediately feel the scavenger birds circling...

(Cut to shaky overhead shot of everyone gathered together in the Pepsi
room.  Daria and Jodie sit on one side of the room, the rest of the house
sits on the other.  Daria seems calm, almost amused by the whole situation.
Everyone else is serious... even Kevin.)

DARIA: (offscreen voice-over)  So to think that all this time, while I was
finding reasons to dislike my housemates, they, *too*, were piecing
together  clues from my behavior and jumping to their own conclusions.
(Bt)  This experience just keeps getting more and more positive.

(There's a silence in the room that's diluted only by the annoying music
playing, until at last Sandi breaks it.)

SANDI:  Well, where should we start?

KEVIN: (leaping up, pointing a finger accusingly)  You're *OUT* of the
house, Daria!!!

(Daria cocks an eyelid, unfazed.)

SANDI: (annoyed)  *Kevin*.  Not so fast.  We have to give her a *trial*
first, like they did with Puck in "Real World: San Francisco."  That's,
like, the most *civilized* method.

JODIE: (angry)  No it's *not*!  Guys, this is *stupid*.  You don't have any
reason to be mad at Daria.  Sandi, you barely knew who she *was* until two
weeks ago.

SANDI:  So??  Didn't Skip tell us the purpose of our living together was,
like, to get to *know* each other??

DARIA: (deadpan)  That amongst other beads of wisdom.

(Sandi glares at her.)

SANDI:  Well I've *gotten* to know her, and I don't think I *want* to any
longer.  She's like this creepy-crawly person who gets under your *skin*.
No wonder Skip kept getting mad at her.

JODIE:  Why should Skip's reaction matter so much?

SANDI:  Well he is, like, our *boss*, in case you've forgotten.

JODIE:  I sure haven't.  How *could* I when you remind us every few minutes?

SANDI: (frowning)  What's *that* supposed to mean?

JODIE:  It means --

DARIA: (sighing)  Look, this is *my* inquisition, is it not?  Why don't we
get down to business.

KEVIN:  *Yeah*.  You're *OUT* of the house, Daria!

DARIA: (rolling her eyes)  Shut up.

SANDI: (to Jodie)  There now, you *see*??  She, like, can't be nice to
*anyone*.

TIFFANY:  Yeah.  That girl's always saying how stupid we are.

UPCHUCK:  You *do* put forth an unpleasant demeanor, Daria my sweet.

(Daria cocks an eyelid.)

JODIE:  Well I've known Daria longer than some of you have.  She may seem
stand-offish, she may say things that sound a bit harsh, but inside, she's
a *really* sweet person.

(Daria reddens a little at her praise.  The others take a moment to absorb
Jodie's remark.)

JODIE:  Come *on* -- you've lived with her for two weeks, and you haven't
seen her do *one* nice thing?

(Pause.  The others glance at each other, then pause to think for several
seconds.  Slowly, Kevin, Upchuck, Jamie, and even Tiffany get uncomfortable
looks on their faces.)

JAMIE: (hesitant)  Well... I guess it's true she hasn't really been *mean*.

KEVIN:  Yeah... she kinda just sits in the corner... like a stray dog, or
somethin'.

DARIA:  Thank you, Kevin.

(Jodie looks pointedly at Sandi.  Sandi at first returns her gaze
defiantly, then glances at Daria and rolls her eyes.)

SANDI: (grudging)  All right.  Let us say that I *did* exaggerate some of
her *wrongs* against myself -- that would *still* leave the peanut butter
incident.  You can't deny that she acted in an *insulting* manner when she
*put* it in her mouth and said that it had gone to a *better* place.

JODIE:  Sandi, I'm sure Daria didn't mean to use your peanut butter.  And
I'm *definitely* sure she didn't use it with the sole purpose of getting on
your nerves.

DARIA:  Actually... I did.

SANDI & JODIE:  What??

(Pause.  The other housemembers gaze at Daria with interest.  Sandi looks
both irritated and smug, while Jodie looks stunned.)

DARIA:  Or rather, I should say that I was looking for a way to get on
people's nerves, and the peanut butter became a convenient mode of
transportation.

JODIE:  But why??

(Pause.  Cut to frontal close-up of Jodie in the share box.)

JODIE:  I have to say I was shocked when I heard her say that.  I mean this
is *Daria*.  She reacts, she doesn't *act* -- especially not in a way that
could hurt people's feelings.  It makes me wonder what else I don't know
about her...

(Resume present shot of the group.  Daria remains impassive, but there's
the slightest hint that she regrets her admission.  She turns to Sandi.)

DARIA:  I think *you* might understand the reason.  What's the point of my
being real?  No one else was, so why should I?  We're not here to get to
know each other, we're here to be on television -- which involves being as
inconsiderate and attention-grabbing as possible.  So I chose to do
something that would provoke an instant negative response.  And here we are.

(Pause.  Sandi looks a bit uncomprehending for a few seconds.  Daria lowers
her eyes.)

DARIA:  And... I regret it.

(Pause.  Sandi's still looking at her.  Her face then softens a tad, but
before she can reply: )

QUINN: (offscreen.  sing-songy)  Hel-lohhhhhh.

(Everyone in the group turns to look, stunned, as she enters the doorway.)

DARIA: (under her breath)  You have an unbelievably lousy sense of timing.

TIFFANY: (surprised)  Quinn.

SANDI: (stunned)  What're *you* doing here??

QUINN: (faux chipper)  What d' you *mean*?  Can't a friend and relative
visit her *friend* and *relative*??

(She glances at Daria, then at Tiffany and Jamie.  Her cheerful expression
wavers slightly.  Cut to frontal close-up of Quinn in the share box.  Cue
music: "You Oughtta Know" by Alanis Morissette.)

QUINN:  So, like, I *get* there, and what do I see but Tiffany and Sandi
are, like, *sitting* together.  But even worse -- Jordan was practically
*falling* all over Sandi!  It filled me with... (looks down, as though
she's reading something.) so much unspeakable pain and torment, I was,
like, ready to... perish.  (Pause)  Oh, and Daria was in trouble, or
something.

(Resume present shot of the group.)

JODIE:  Um, we're sort of busy.

QUINN: (walking into the room, cheerfulness fading from her demeanor)  Oh
that's okay, I won't waste your time.  Certainly Sandi didn't waste *hers*.
(Bt.  to Sandi)  Y' know I came here expecting to find that  you'd lured
Tiffany away from me, and I was right.  (turns to Tiffany.  frustrated,
resentful.)  So *go* ahead, Tiffany, why don't you be *her* vice-president
again?  Or maybe you two and Stacy can just force *me* to leave the Fashion
Club.

TIFFANY: (genuine surprise)  What are you talking about, Quinn?

SANDI: (to Tiffany)  You were going to make *me* president??

QUINN:  Oh, like it wasn't your whole *stupid* plan all along.  (looks at
Jamie.)  But *Jordan*, too?  God, Sandi, d' you have to steal *everyone*
who's attached to me??

SANDI: (indignant)  I didn't, like, *steal* them from you.  They weren't
*yours* to begin with.

QUINN:  Like I'm *really* gonna believe you.

SANDI: (more indignant)  Hey, just because you weren't up to being in
*charge* of them is *no* reason to take it out on me.  Just because your
lax example caused Tiffany to fall astray into the arms of a *pervert*...
(her eyes trail toward Upchuck.)

(Tiffany goes pale.  Quinn catches Sandi's meaning, looks at Upchuck with
horror.)

QUINN:  Ewwwwww!  *Tiffany*!!!

UPCHUCK:  Why do all ladies react to the Chuckster this way?

(Beat)

JODIE:  I hate to say it, Sandi, but I can't blame her for not believing
you.  Like Daria said, you haven't been real to us *once* since we got
here.

SANDI: (irritated)  Oh, so you're, like, against me *too* now, are you?
What a surprise.

(Beat)

JODIE:  Against you?? (standing up, with a sudden flare of irritation.)
Well if *I'm* against you, it wasn't by *choice*, believe me.  In fact, one
of the things I hoped for *most* when we came here was to find out what
makes you *act* the way you do.  I really wanted to find out that you
weren't a complete bitch.

(Sandi goes pale.  The others, even Quinn, look rather stunned by Jodie's
bluntness.)

JODIE:  But instead all I've seen is a snotty, negative attitude and a
devotion to sticking to the role *Skip* picked for you.  Is being noticed
on TV *so* important that you can't just be *nice*, even a little??

SANDI: (angry)  Like, *when* did this stupid meeting start being about
*me*??  Who *says* I haven't been nice to anyone?!

TIFFANY: (very softly)  She has.  (No one hears her.)

SANDI:  Just because I know how to take *advantage* of an opportunity when
it hits, just because I don't want to be some *loser* who wakes up at age
*thirty* and finds she's wasted her life modeling for *used* car ads when
--

QUINN: (rolling her eyes)  Oh *give* it up, Sandi.  Gawd, *anyone* could do
a better job acting victimized than *you* can.  Makes me wonder how you
even *landed* the vixen role.  (to the group.)  Maybe she just had her
*mom* buy it for her.

(Sandi knows what Quinn's making an allusion to.  She vaults off the couch,
stands across from Quinn so that they're only a couple of inches apart.)

SANDI: (dead serious)  You leave her out of this.

QUINN: (not cowed)  Why??  It's true, isn't it??

SANDI: (face turning purplish-red)  *No*... no it is *not* true.

(Quinn appears ready to make a retort, when she gets a tap on the arm from
Jamie.)

JAMIE:  Quinn... (shakes his head slightly.)

(She looks at him with surprise -- none of the J's has ever tried to
restrain her before.  At first she glares at him, then she realizes that
her comment *was* on the nasty side, and gets a somewhat remorseful look on
her face.  Meanwhile Sandi's bright red, shaking slightly, and seems
oblivious to the other people.)

SANDI:  She had *nothing* to do with this.  She didn't buy me *anything*.

JODIE: (cool)  Other than the vice-presidency.

SANDI: (swerving to face her)  I never *asked* her to do that!

JODIE:  No, but you went along with it, didn't you??  So a part of you
must've thought it was okay.

(Meanwhile Quinn quietly slips away and takes a seat next to Daria.
Daria's been watching this exchange with an impassive, yet intent,
expression.)

DARIA: (offscreen voice-over)  I was well aware that *my* presence at this
meeting had long been forgotten.  This was now a meeting of three
individuals.  (Bt.  glances at Quinn.)  Or should I say... two.

SANDI:  No I *didn't*.  I *didn't* think it was okay.  There're a *lot* of
things I wish she wouldn't do!

JODIE: (getting pissed)  But you're still not sorry enough to resign as
vice-president, *are* you??  Just as *long* as you're in the spotlight,
that's all that matters, *doesn't* it??

DARIA: (offscreen voice-over)  I'll confess that during this exchange, a
part of me waited in vain for Jodie's cooler head to prevail.

SANDI:  Where do *you* get off saying that type of stuff, *Landon*?!  What
makes you think you can just, like, tell me what I'm *thinking*??   You
must believe you're a total *saint* -- Miss I-always-have
to-be-in-charge-of-*everything*!

JODIE:  Hey, at least I *earned* all my top positions!  That's right --
*earned* them, something which I don't think *you* know much about.  *I*
didn't just waltz into them after cheating or buying them or hurting people
or sleeping around or *whatever* the hell you do.

SANDI:  I *never* d--

JODIE:  You may think you're getting something from all this exposure, but
you know what -- you're *not*.  All you're showing people is what a
*coward* and a fraud you are!

DARIA: (trying to intervene)  You guys, let's just --

JODIE: (not hearing her)  And don't think *I'm* the only one who feels that
way.  I'll bet everyone in this room shares my opinion, and so do the
others on the Student Council.  We *all* think that, every time there's a
meeting.  We watch you sitting at our table, knowing *you're* the only one
of us who didn't work her *ass* off to get into elected office.  And at the
end of each meeting, we leave feeling sick to our stomachs.  That's right,
Sandi -- you make us *sick*!

(Daria sits on the couch, watching her with an impassive, yet slightly
resigned, expression.  Cut to close-up of her in the share box, wearing
that same expression.)

DARIA: (offscreen voice-over)  Jodie was saying all the things that needed
to be said.  I freely confess that it felt good to watch Sandi squirm under
the glare of a spotlight she hadn't sought after.  (Pause)  And yet... I'd
seen Jodie spout off before... I'd even seen her *blow* up before, but this
is the first time I'd watched her sustain her hostility for so long.  While
the cynical side of me says "who cares?", the small part of me that takes
comfort in the existence of naive, idealistic fools who want everyone to
get along was... disturbed.

(Resume present shot.  Sandi is looking at Jodie with a tightly-controlled
expression, seeming stunned, hurt, and very angry all at once.  Jodie
stares at her back with the same tight control.  You sense there's more
nastiness ahead.)

DARIA:  ... and I question whether this hostile side of Jodie is more
influential than she would ever admit.

(Suddenly Kevin, who has been a passive audience this whole time, jumps off
the couch and points a finger at Sandi.)

KEVIN:  You're OUT of the house!!!

SANDI: (turning the full force of her emotions on him)  Why don't *YOU* get
out of the house, *KEVIN*?!!

KEVIN:  But I'm the good guy.

JODIE: (to Sandi)  Maybe you should do what he says.

SANDI:  Or maybe *you* should!

UPCHUCK:  C' mon ladies, let's quell the catfight...

SANDI & JODIE:  *SHUT UP*!!

QUINN:  *HEY*, like, I don't care if you *ALL* get out of the house!!!
I've still got to deal with the problem of Tiffany and Jordan being
*stolen* from me!

JAMIE:  Hey, um, can I *please* say something?

SANDI: (snappy)  Not if *you're* just gonna snap at me like all the others!

QUINN:  And if you're gonna lick Sandi's boots, then don't even *bother*
talking to me!

JAMIE:  I wasn't gonna--

SANDI:  Just be *quiet*, Justin.

QUINN:  It's *Jordan*.

JAMIE:  It's *JAAAAMIE*!!!

(Pause.  His outburst causes everyone in the room to go silent.  Each
person gets a stunned look on his or her face.  Meanwhile Jamie is shaking
and looking very close to tears.)

JAMIE:  Man... I was just gonna try and get you guys to calm down, but why
even *bother*??  No one here seems to care what I think.  And you guys
(looks at Sandi and Quinn), you-you treat me like I'm *nothing*!

(Pause.  Sandi and Quinn slowly go from shocked to remorseful.  They eye
each other uneasily.  The shock and anger fade from Jodie's face, getting
replaced by mortification. Daria cocks an eyelid.)

(fade-out.  fade-in to:)

SCENE 3 (montage)

(Cue music: "Everybody Hurts" by R.E.M.)

(Shaky shot of the outside.  Cut to frontal close-up of Jodie in the share
box.)

JODIE: (sober)  And all this time I thought Sandi was the only poser in
this house.  It turns out a lot of us have been... myself included.  (Bt)
I was so busy thinking I was the "good guy" and feeling like I had to drill
it into Sandi's head, that I completely overlooked all the people who
weren't as able to make themselves be heard.  I'm sorry.  (Pause)  I think
we *all* are...

(Cut to shaky shot of Daria and Jodie sitting in their room, both wearing
sober expressions.)

(Cut to shaky shot of Sandi and Tiffany in their room, *also* wearing sober
expressions.  Sandi's gazing at a closed notebook in her lap, and Tiffany
stares at herself in a mirror, for once not enjoying it.)

(Cut to shaky shot of Quinn sitting on the stairs, head in hands.)

(Cut to shaky shot of Kevin standing in the kitchen.  He tosses a football
against the wall over and over, until it finally hits him in the head and
falls to the floor.)

(Cut to shaky shot of Jamie sitting on the Pepsi room couch, by himself,
looking bleak.)

(Cut to shaky shot of Upchuck flipping through a Victoria's Secret
catalogue.  For once, he seems to show a lack of interest.)

(Cut to shaky shot of Daria walking into the kitchen.  She sees Kevin, goes
over to where he is standing.)

DARIA: (offscreen voice-over)  After what happened, it would have been easy
for me to let each day drift into the next, until three full weeks had
passed.  Then I could have gone back to Jane and chalked up this experience
as another example of the world going to hell.  But...

(Daria leans down, picks up the football, and hands it to Kevin.)

DARIA: (offscreen voice-over)  ...somehow it didn't seem like the thing to do.

(Cut to shot of Sandi staring at the notebook.  Finally, in a swift,
decisive action, she opens it and takes a pen.  She starts to scribbling on
the page, furrows her brow with concentration.)

(Cut to shot of Tiffany and Upchuck standing in the hall, talking.  Yes,
*talking*.  Neither of them looks unfriendly.)

(Cut to shot of Jodie walking up to Sandi and Tiffany's door.  She stops,
stands there for several seconds, looking as though she's debating whether
or not to go in.  Finally she heaves a sigh, and keeps walking.)

(Cut to shot of Jamie on the couch.  Quinn comes over and sits beside him,
wearing a contrite expression.  Says a few words that cause Jamie to show a
hint of a smile.)

(Music ends.  fade-out.  fade-in to: )

SCENE 4 (a few days later)

(Herky-jerky pan over of the house.  Cut to shaky inside shot of the seven
housemates in the Pepsi room, looking pretty worn-out.  Skip is standing
over them, having just arrived.)

SKIP: (overly-hyped)  How's it *going*, kids??

ALL:  Mmmmmmmmm...

SKIP:  You'll never guess what I've got for you -- the *first* episode of
"Class Land"!

JODIE:  So soon??

SKIP:  Yep.  We just cobbled together footage from the first couple of
weeks.  We've even tested it with a *focus* group.  And you'll *never*
guess!  (Pause)  Well go on!  Guess!  *Guess*!!

DARIA: The focus group thought we were destined for a spot on Must-See
Thursday.

SKIP: (frowning a little)  Mrrr... no.  (Bt)  Bu-ut SUQZ *did* give us a
premiere timeslot!  They cancelled "Uptown," and we get to go on in its
place!

(Pause)

JODIE:  "Uptown"?  You mean that really cool animated show?

SKIP:  "Cool"??  All it was was a bunch of dull kids in boring jobs hanging
out and talking.

DARIA:  In other words, one of the few programs that made television worth
watching.

SKIP: (frowning again)  Mrrr... nevermind.  (holds up a video tape and
waves it.)  You're gonna *love* seeing how you *really* come across!

(He reaches toward the TV and puts the tape in the VCR, then reaches over
to the wall and flicks off the lights.  The angle is such that we can't see
what's on the TV screen, but almost immediately, the students are
overwhelmed by a gush of loud rock music and swirling colors.  fade-out.)

(Fade-in to a short time later, the end of the episode.  All of the
housemates except Kevin and Upchuck appear to be showing little enthusiasm.
Skip leans forward and turns off the TV, then flicks on the lights.)

SKIP:  So what d' you think??

KEVIN: (leaping up.  Enthused)  Man, I look *good*!

UPCHUCK:  You *did* somehow manage to bring out my debonair *charms*.
Grrrrrr...

(long Pause.  Skip gestures at the girls.)

TIFFANY:  The camera didn't make me look *too* fat.

SANDI:  Yes, it was nice... I guess.  (Bt)  But how come *Quinn* was in it
so much??  She was only here for, like, an *hour*.

ALL BUT DARIA:  *Yeah*.

SKIP:  Because the camera just *loves* her.  She lights up every scene --
er, I mean, *situation*.  It would have been a horrific, God-awful tragedy
*not* to include her.

JODIE:  All right, fine.  But then why were the scenes edited in such a
disorganized way?  I got nauseous from all those quick, shaky-cam cuts, and
the share box scenes had almost *no* connection to what went on in the
episode.

SKIP:  Mrrrr... you'll have to take it up with the editors.  (Bt.  turns to
Daria.)  Well, Sarcasm Queen, what did *you* think??

(Beat)

DARIA:  I think you made exactly the episode you set out to make.

SKIP:  Aw, *thanks*.

DARIA:  Something easily digestible that causes the blood to leave your brain.

SKIP:  Mrrrrrrr...

DARIA:  What did the focus group think?

SKIP: (enthused again)  They thought it was *fantastic*!  Can't *wait* to
see more!  This show's really gonna be a *gold* mine.  Especially with the
cable rights, which let us show it over and over and *over* again in
marathons and spin-offs...

(Daria rolls her eyes.)

SKIP:  Except... there *was* a slight quibble with some of the casting choices.

(Everyone turns to look at Daria.)

DARIA: (calmly)  Say no more.  I'd be happy to bow out right now and
pretend this whole thing never happened.

SKIP:  Oh *no*, Daria, not *you*.  The focus group *loved* you.  Cynical,
sarcastic, stirring up people's venom -- that's what they want!  (Bt)  And
Sandi.  They *really* loved Sandi.

(In response, Sandi manages a rather lukewarm smirk.)

SKIP:  We've already got you signed up to be on "Classroom On the Road."
*And* in each of the installments of "Class Wars," where we pit members of
each cast against each other in *brutal* competition!

DARIA:  Finally a scenario that *does* reflect real life.

(Beat)

JODIE: (cool)  Congratulations, Sandi.

(Sandi nods slowly.)

SKIP:  I mean *really*, you were *all* fantastic, but... (gaze trails over
to Jodie and Tiffany.)  Some of you haven't fulfilled your potential.

JODIE: (wary)  How so?

(Beat)

SKIP:  Well... Tiffany -- (turns to her.) your brief fling with Chuck was
promising, but... the group felt that considering your background, you
weren't resentful or confused about your identity enough.

TIFFANY:  O-kaaay.

SKIP:  And Jodie -- (looks at her.)  your blow-up with Sandi showed *real*
potential, although I *will* confess that up until then, you were pretty
much a girl scout.

JODIE: (sardonic)  And girl scouts just aren't viewer-friendly, right?

SKIP:  *Right-o*!  But never fear: as pertaining to your contracts, you'll
have an extended three months to get your act together.

ALL:  *Huh*??

DARIA:  Funny, I have my contract right here, and -- (starts to pull it out
of her pocket.)

SKIP: (nervous.  waving her off)  Oh-oh-err... yours has a *typo*, so you
can't see that clause the way you can on the other contracts.  Which I'd
show you, but -- gotta *go*!  (heads toward the door.)  Oh, and if it turns
out that certain cogs in the machine continue not to function properly,
(again, eyes trail toward Jodie and Tiffany.) then don't hesitate to
replace them with ones that will.  Cheerio!  (leaves.)

(long Pause.  The group just sits there, eyeing the cameraman with slightly
sickened expressions, even Kevin and Upchuck.)

DARIA:  So we're stuck together for another three months.

JODIE: (weary)  Not *us*. (gestures at Tiffany.)  He wants you guys to kick
us out, doesn't he?  So he can replace us with people who are more
*exciting*.

(Pause)

ALL:  Quinn.

SANDI: (frustrated)  But dammit, I don't *want* Tiffany to get kicked out.
She's, like, been a *really* good friend to me, an' I didn't see any of
*that* up on the screen.

JODIE:  And Michael was over here a lot, talking to me about how his
grandmother had passed away, and he got maybe ten seconds *total*.

JAMIE: (hesitant)  Look... I, um, wouldn't feel right if I kicked anybody out.

KEVIN:  Well *I* might -- (cringes a little.)  but you guys'd probably just
yell at me some more.

DARIA:  So it's settled -- no one gets kicked out?  (Everyone nods.)  And
yet no one wants to live together for another three months, correct?  (More
vehement nods.)  So the question is: what's the quickest way we can
slaughter this cash cow?

(long Pause)

JODIE: (face brightening)  I know!  We'll just be really *nice* to each
other this next week.  We'll help each other out, listen to each other's
problems... we'll be so boring, Skip and Ms. Li will be dying to let us out
of our contracts.

(long Pause)

ALL BUT JODIE:  No way.

DARIA:  All forgiveness aside, could you really see us sticking with it for
more than an hour?

(Beat)

JODIE: (disheartened)  I guess not.

KEVIN:  Then, like, what *should* we do, dudes??  All this thinking's,
like, making my head hurt.

(long Pause.  Then Daria smirks wickedly.)

DARIA:  I think I know...

(fade-out.  fade-in to: )

SCENE 5 (a few days later)

(Normal outside shot of the house at night.)

SKIP: (offscreen voice-over)  What do you *mean* you can't get any footage
on them?!  They didn't paint over your lenses, did they?!

CAMERAMAN: (offscreen voice-over)  No, it's not that.

SKIP:  Then *what*??

C.M:  It's just... they haven't done anything for *days* worth filming.

SKIP:  What are you *talking* about?!  They were just *perfect* a few days
ago!  There's *no* way in hell they could change so quickly!

C.M: (insistent)  But they *have*...

(Cut to inside shot of the house.  All seven housemates are gathered in the
Pepsi room, along with Quinn, Stacy, and Jane.  Daria and Jane are snoozing
lightly, Jodie's reading, and the rest watch television intently.)

C.M: (offscreen voice-over)  They've just been sitting there, day and
night, only moving to shower, eat, sleep, and go to school.

SKIP: (offscreen voice-over)  Why??  In God's name, *why*?!

QUINN: (zombie-like)  Puck getting kicked out of the house.

(Beat)

SANDI: (zombie-like)  Fuh-nee.

(Beat)

ALL:  Heh, heh-heh-heh, heh, heh-heh...

SKIP:  My God, it *can't* be!  Call MTV and make them shut it off!!!

C.M:  I tried, but they said that the Super-duper jumbo-sized "Real World
-Road Rules" megathon *has* to continue for another two weeks, even at the
expense of more worthwile programming.  (Bt)  Oh, and they also said sorry
they didn't warn viewers ahead of time -- they're bad about that kind of
stuff.

SKIP:  Oh God, those self-serving IDIOTS!!  (Bt)  Well then *cut* the
cable!  Cut the *power*!

C.M:  Sorry, Skip, we've tried everything, but I'm afraid these kids are
lost forever.

(We hear sounds of Skip bursting into tears.)

(Beat.  Quinn stirs slightly from her zombie-like state and turns to Tiffany.)

QUINN:  Were we fighting about something?

(Tiffany shrugs.  They continue to watch the marathon.)

SCENE 6 (Lawndale High, a few days later)

(Shot of outside.  Cut to shot of Daria and Jane standing at their lockers.)

DARIA: (smirking)  So we finally found something we could all do together.

JANE: (also smirking)  And the dirtbags in charge were undone by the vapid
entertainment they sought to imitate.  Cunning move, amiga.

DARIA:  Things're finally back to normal.  Being a lonely, neglected
outcast never felt so good.

(She gestures at some students who walk past her without noticing.)

JANE:  But not for long.  Don't they still have enough footage to make a
season's worth of episodes?

DARIA:  Maybe so, but not if MTV has anything to say about it.  As soon as
they found out Skip had a rip-off of "The Real World" planned, they threatened
to haul his Armani-covered rear into court unless he canceled it.  Which he
promptly did.

JANE:  Geez, voyeurism, lawsuits... is there no sewer MTV *won't* crawl
though?

DARIA:  Maybe the one that runs beneath a library.

JANE:  Right.  But at least that means "Class Land" is dead.  *Good* and dead.

DARIA:  And buried.

(She smirks.  Just then, Jodie walks up to them.)

JODIE:  Hey, you guys.  Talking about "Class Land," huh?

DARIA:  That, and sources of waste disposal.

JODIE: (making a sour idea)  You were right: that show *was* a bad idea.
We didn't get to know each other -- we just *got* to each other.

DARIA:  Hmm, I don't know.  (Bt)  In spite of my early reservations, I'd
have to say that... (rolls her eyes, grudging)  we *did* manage to come
together when it counted.

JODIE: (smiling faintly)  Yeah, that's true.

DARIA:  And I learned a lot more about what makes people tick than I ever
thought possible.

(She cocks an eyelid pointedly at Jodie, who misses what she's talking about.)

JODIE: (nodding)  Yeah, like Jamie.  I'd've never known he was so upset if
he hadn't said so.  (Bt)  Too bad he had to shout it out.

JANE:  Who's Jamie?

JODIE:  (frowning)  You know I *still* don't think Sandi's apologized to
him.  (Bt)  Do you?

(Pause.  Daria shrugs.)

JANE: (sounding a little sour)  I've given up on expecting Sandi to
apologize for *anything* she does...

(Cut to shot of Sandi standing at her locker with the door opened, peering
at herself in the mirror, so that her back is turned.  Jamie comes up
rather hesitantly behind her.  Sandi feels a presence behind her and
instinctively flinches, expecting it to be a camera.  But when she sees
that it's Jamie, she relaxes.)

SANDI:  Oh.  It's just you.

JAMIE:  I've been doing that a lot, too.

(Sandi nods vaguely.  An awkward pause follows.)

JAMIE:  Um... (blushes a little) thanks for... writing me that letter.

(Pause)

SANDI: (reddening)  Yeah.  Well... I thought if I said it out loud, people
might think I was being fake, or whatever.  (Pause.  more decisive)  But
*don't* let it get around.  (smirks a tad.)  I have a *reputation* to
uphold.

(Jamie nods, smiles a bit.)

JAMIE:  Okay.  (Pause)  So I'll see you around?

SANDI:  Yeah, around...

(They exchange nods one more time, and then Jamie turns to leave.  Sandi
watches him go.)

SANDI:  ...Jamie.

COMMENTARY


As Daria would say: Ummm......

Okay, so I've caught one or two episodes of "The Real World." : >
Actually, my history with that show is as follows: first two seasons I
wasn't interested, but when the San Francisco cast rolled around, I got
into it.  How could I not??  It was a stone's throw away from where I live.
After that, I remained interested enough to watch the London cast, and to
take note of any patterns that were starting to emerge.  Signs of prima
donna behavior were apparent as early as the first season, but it reached
its absolute peak on "Real World: Miami."  That season, plus real life
responsibilities, turned me off to the series.  After that, I caught a
handful of episodes of Boston, Seattle, and Hawaii, but my interest was
depleted.

By prima donna behavior, I mean that people went into that show expecting
to show off.  They had watched previous episodes; they knew how it was
done.  They were supposed to talk to the camera and sound deep (most of
them failing); they were also supposed to pull off crazy stunts, like
diving nude into the swimming pool (Hawaii), mooning the camera (London...
and other casts, I'm sure), and more.  Getting along was not an option.
Conflict was, and still is, a priority.  I seriously believe that the
London cast was the last one to feature semi-normal people.  After that,
you get the occasionally normal person, and a lot of posers.  Most people
who audition for the show (judging from the film clips) behave like they
want to be actors or models.

Anyhow, Sandi's, Kevin's, and Upchuck's behavior in my fanfic perfectly
illustrates what I've been saying.  (Btw: "Real World" fans, feel free to
argue that I'm wrong...)

"The Real World," as opposed to "Daria," is MTV's baby.  Marathons are
shown frequently, episodes are on twice a day (when's the last time you
were able to catch an ep. of *our* favorite show??), and merchandizing is
through the roof.  Besides T-shirts, mugs, whatever (easily accessible at a
chainstore near you, unlike the merchandise for a certain other show),
they've even got something called "The Real World Diaries."  In that, you
see the cast members' handwriting and what was *supposedly* their thought
process during the six months they spent together.  I had actually planned
a segment where the cast of Class Land learns that they have been
merchandised in such a way, but I couldn't fit it in. : <

But anyway, that's the main reason why I decided to do a spoof of "The Real
World."  What could be a better example of a promising idea (watching
strangers learn to get along) being poisoned by greed and interest in
entertainment above all else??  Yet also, I wanted to do a spoof because I
realized a while back that one aspect of "Daria" that I hadn't covered was
its social commentary.  I had plenty of character-building fics, but not
one that addressed an insideous part of our culture.  I hope I did an
adequate job here...

That said, this fic was excruciating to write!  Many times, my brain felt
as though it were being twisted around inside my head.  That's because on
top of showing what it would be like if the LHS students were in a "Real
World" episode, I also wanted to show what it'd be like if they were forced
to live together -- what sort of relationships, loyalties would develop,
etc.  I wanted to do it *realistically*, and that required walking a fine
line between a completely outrageous parody of "The Real World" (which, in
my opinion, would only work in a stand-alone, fantasy ep.-type way) and one
of my usual character-building fanfics.  On top of that, I took a stab at
addressing the age-old question: what is "real"?  I'm not sure I answered
it in any satisfactory way.

I kept feeling as though I didn't develop the conflicts as well as I could
have -- Sandi versus Daria, for instance, might have seemed somewhat
abrupt.  But we could also look at it another way, as illustrating Daria's
point  that on "The Real World," each "trivial, stupid conflicts gets blown
into a crisis."  So the Sandi peanut butter thing could be seen as just
that.  Also, the fact that relationships never got developed as well as
they might have could be viewed as another symptom of "Real World"itis:
television intrudes too much upon people's private lives, preventing them
from doing the little things that need to be done in order to form
relationships.

Did that make sense? : >

Well, by the time this comes out, I will have all but completed my two
thesis papers and earned my B.A at U.C. Berkeley.  I hated that it took me
so long to complete this fanfic -- though I did warn you in the postscript
of "None in the Family, Part Two" that this could happen.  Besides, I have
a feeling that #12 would have taken me a while, anyway.

Now see what happened?  You all kept saying that I put out a fanfic every
other week, and *look* -- you jinxed me! : >

***Points of Interest***

For the people who don't watch "The Real World," these might interest you.
And for those who watch semi-regularly, they might interest you, too...

1) The "shaky cam" technique, not to mention abrupt cuts to new scenes and
pan-overs of scenery are all mainstays of "The Real World" -- hence, the
reason why I chose to mock them.

2) The segment which Daria and Quinn watch in the opening scene comes from
"Real World: San Francisco."  In that particular episode, six housemates
finally confront Puck, a super-obnoxious bike messenger, during a house
meeting.  The result is that Pedro, the housemate least able to tolerate
Puck, blows up at him, then gets drawn into a heated argument.  Finally,
Puck moves out of the house -- but his obnoxiousness lives on in various
"Real World" reunion episodes...

3) Daria: "'Cause for some reason, this whole set-up seems painfully
familiar."  That line alludes to Tracy Grandstaff's participation in "The
Real World" pilot?  Yes, the beloved voice of Daria was actually on TRW!
Oh the horror...

4) Music playing during scenes is another mainstay of "The Real World."
Actually, it's a mainstay of nearly all MTV programs (including "Daria"),
but is particularly noticeable on this show.  Any time a housemate shows
any emotion, the sappy music plays, as if the makers of the show don't
trust us to feel for them on our own.  In many cases, I tried to choose
appropriately cheesy music (like Jewel).

And I noticed that not all of the music used on "The Real World" dates from
this year -- hence, a lot of entries that were several years old.

5) The parts where students protest their town being filmed comes directly
from life.  Supposedly, during the past few "Real World" seasons, locals
got so fed up with the way the show depicted their cities, they shouted and
threw things at "Real World" cast members whenever they went out in public.
How's that for a dose of reality??

6) My reference to the students having to work in a nightclub: Ever since
"Real World: Miami," cast members have had a little responsibility tossed
into their cushy situation.  This could involve running a business, or (as
in the case of "Real World: Boston") doing community service.  The most
infamous example of responsibility gone wrong comes from the Miami cast.
On top of living in a million-dollar mansion, they got fifty thousand
dollars to invest in running a business... and they couldn't do it!
Perhaps it was foolhardy of the RW executives to expect them to -- seven
strangers who were living together for six months.  But still, I can just
imagine how many hard-working people looking to start a business would have
wanted their prima donna heads on a platter.

7)  Yes, the reference to "Uptown" is in honor of "Downtown," MTV's *other*
terrific animated show that died before its time...

Now for some fanfic-related points:

Jane's reference to the Guptys' marriage therapy show: That will be
addressed more in my next fanfic...

More on Sandi: Well, she finally did something nice, didn't she?  And I
said we'd see more activity on her in fanfic #14, and so we shall. : >  Let
me also add that I realize plenty of people have done Sandi on Daria fics,
but it's usually from the angle of Sandi bullying Daria for being an
outcast.  I thought it'd be interesting, for a change, if Sandi felt
victimized by Daria's sarcastic remarks.  Taking a cue from the show, I
figured that Sandi would be so unfamiliar with Daria's personality that she
wouldn't realize Daria was generally a sarcastic person.

Sandi and Jodie: More of their conflict will arise a couple of fics down
the road...

Daria:  I thought she came across as reflective and rather philosophical in
this one.  Part of that's intentional -- Our Heroine is getting hit with
hard truths that she's been trying to hide from, and she's being forced to
think about it more, and to adjust some of her behavior...


And now for... **THE MYSTERIES OF**

This week's mystery examines why I refer to Daria as raising or cocking her
"eyelid" rather than her eyebrow.  Well it's simple, really: unless she
takes off her glasses, you never see her eyebrows.  Whenever she frowns or
gets a stunned expression, her *eyelids* move about.  Just watch...

The greater mystery is why that is the case.  My guess is that it makes
Daria seem even *less* expressive than if we saw her eyebrows move.  Or
else it's just too difficult for the artists to show her brows shifting up
and down.  And *yet*, if you watch the first episode, "Esteemers," you see
that there, she *does* have eyebrows that shift up and down.  So when and
why the folks in charge decided to make a change remains... a mystery.

**Oops!**

I made a couple of goofs when I honored the fan artists a while back.  It's
Diana Morgan, not Diane, and Liliane Grenier, not Lilianne.  The rest,
however, remains as is. : >

Also, I committed a slight error when I failed to credit the source of the
"Sick Sad World" gag I used in "Of Absolute Value."  The one that had:
"Would you want Jennifer Love-Hewitt starring in *your* movie??"  It was an
allusion to "Daria: the Movie" by Aaron and Barry Adelman, of course.  The
funny thing is, I didn't even know they were going to make an actual movie
when I wrote that gag, not to mention put it out a week after "Of Absolute
Value" was posted.  I was just making a reference to their awesome website.
So it seems as though I timed my fanfic to plug the "movie," when in fact
it was a lucky coincidence!

Now for some **Acknowledgements**

I have many people to thank this time around!  I'd like to start with Mike
Quinn for his musical and various other contributions. : >  Also, for being
the one to take the first step toward putting a Helen fanclub into action.
When I spoke of a fanclub in my last postscript, it was with
tongue-in-cheek -- yet it seemed as though many actually *were* interested
in having one.  Mike was the first to e-mail Paperpusher (aka Rich aka
rich) about the idea, and we're in the process of putting it together.
I'll keep you informed!

Also special thanks to Paperpusher for being enthusiastic about the idea
and for putting it into action in several ways (such as creating a private
group, etc.).  There's certainly no way I'd be able to do half of what
you've done. : >

And a kudos to Crazy Nutso (aka Bob) for writing a durn enjoyable fanfic
called "'Shipper Wars."  For those of you who don't know about it, it's
mainly full of insider jokes between the 'shippers and anti-'shippers (the
latter of which I am a card-carrying member).  You may just want to peruse
it for a dose of silly fun...

And finally, thanks to C.L. Basso for working *so* hard to correct flaws in
my first eleven fanfics.  I think when I've got thirteen together, I'll
redistribute them, so those embarrassing spelling errors will be no more! :
>

And thanks to the people who've recently put my work up at their sites.
It's fun to cruise around the pages and read their summaries...

Aw hell, thanks *everyone*!  You're wonderful! : >


To those people and the rest who have my stuff showing at their websites:
if you don't have a URL, and I haven't sent you my latest fic(s), just
write a polite e-mail to bug me... :-)
