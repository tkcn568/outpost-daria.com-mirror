to...</I>)<BR><BR>(<I>Scene: Landon living room. Jodie, in her tattered jeans
and a baggy white T-shirt, is standing in the hallway with a bag over her
shoulder. Lehrer is standing in the open doorway, with Andrew Landon right in
his face. Michelle is in the background, unsure as to exactly how to handle
this.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Andrew:</B> You are not taking my daughter
<B>anywhere</B>.<BR><BR><B>Lehrer:</B> Mr Landon, it's a simple holiday trip.
Yer daughter'll be perfectly safe with...<BR><BR><B>Andrew:</B> I don't believe
a word of it, mister -- so who <B>else</B> is going on this ...
trip?<BR><BR><B>Lehrer:</B> Some of the more intellectual
students...<BR><BR><B>Andrew:</B> Stop <B>right</B> there. I know what
<B>that</B> means at Lawndale High, and if that Cullen girl's involved, my
Jodie's not going anywhere <B>near</B> it. Don't think I don't know what you're
doing, Mister...<BR><BR><B>Jodie:</B> Dad, look...<BR><BR><B>Andrew:</B> Stay
out of this, Jodie; you don't know what you're talking about. You may
<B>think</B> these people are your friends, but I've heard stories -- why do you
think they won't go by their real names? (<I>turning to Lehrer</I>) Now she's
staying <B>right</B> here, and damn be to the
consequences!<BR><BR><B>Lehrer:</B> Look, mate, <B>you're</B> the one who
doesn't know what he's on about...<BR><BR><B>Jodie:</B>
Dad...<BR><BR><B>Andrew:</B> Shut <B>up</B>, Jodie! You're not going with these
people and that's <B>final</B>!<BR><BR>(<I>Lehrer, a fed-up look on his face,
simply lays Andrew out. Without a backwards glance, Lehrer turns and leaves.
Jodie follows, but turns back to see Rachel, in a nightgown, looking at the
scene with large eyes. Jodie closes her own eyes and walks out. Fade to black,
with white writing reading...</I>)<BR><BR><B><FONT size=+1>
<CENTER>A FAMILY HOLIDAY</CENTER></FONT></B><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: a dark corridor.
DJ, catlike, prowls along it. She opens a door, slowly steps inside -- then the
lights come up; it's a square room, desk, chair with its back to the door -- and
an armed guard, drawn down on DJ.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Guard:</B> Hey, Mr Norton, look
what we caught.<BR><BR>(<I>DJ closes her eyes and stands stone-still as the
chair turns slowly to reveal a tall, powerfully-built man with reddish hair
whose face bears a resemblance to that of the late Bryce
Merritt.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Norton:</B> That perimeter guard just earned his
keep.<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Black screen. White writing reads "18 December, 2000". Fade
up to...</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: CU on Daria's face -- pale, soot-streaked
and very still. Music: Coal Chamber -- "Not Living". After a moment, her eyes flutter open. Pan out on a generic
spare bedroom, furnished and decorated by someone with a lot of money, an IKEA
catalogue and no imagination -- this is obviously one more room in the Cullen
house Lynn didn't destroy or redo. Daria, lying on the bed, turns her head to
see Warlock watching her.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> What're
<B>you</B>...<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> I caught up with the Peril saving your life
outside Biers. Brought you back here to recover. (<I>beat</I>) How're you
feeling?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Someone tried to kill me. I'm confused,
frightened, and more angry than I've ever been in my life. And if you don't tell
me what the hell's going on, I'm pulling a Lynn on... (<I>'Oooh THERE'S a
thought...'</I>) She...<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> She'll be right as rain when the
tranqs wear off. (<I>sighing at Daria's stunned look</I>) When she was sure you
were going to live, she made for her car with the intention to track Refugee
down and feed him his kidneys. (<I>shrug</I>) Had to take her down
somehow.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> (<I>raised eyebrow</I>)
'Refugee'?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Rogue assassin now on semi-permanent hire for
the Merritts. Dangerous mofo. For now, that's all you need to
know.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> (<I>trying to find context</I>) So he's to them what
DJ is to you? (<I>Warlock's good at the mask. Daria's better at seeing behind
it. Sledgehammer time.</I>) So what's the plan now?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Scar
and Pagebert brought Narcissa, Scarlet, Maverick and the Four
Musicmen...<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> (<I>nearly amused</I>) Neo-Grunge
Earache.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> (<I>very slight snicker</I>) ...Anyways, they
got in awhile ago. We got Lehrer to whip up some cock and bull story about a
field trip over the vacation and fed that to the parents. Except yours -- we
told them the truth.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> You'd better be kidding. My family was
close enough to a complete nervous breakdown. And that was <B>before</B> I met
Lynn.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Told them you were spending Christmas with your
family. Didn't say whether it was big-F or small.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> They were
okay with that?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Or were too scared of Scar to argue.
Either way. (<I>beat</I>) I need to see the Peril. We had your sister pack a bag
for you. Get yourself cleaned up and meet us downstairs in fifteen
minutes.<BR><BR>(<I>Warlock gets up from the chair he's been sitting in and
heads for the door. Daria sits up, going pale as she does
so.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Why a bag? Where are we going?<BR><BR>(<I>Warlock
leaves the room, shutting the door behind him. There is a very short
silence.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> (<I>dry</I>) Why did it have to be
<B>Quinn</B> doing the packing?<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: Lynn's room. Music plays on. Lynn sprawled
on top of her bedclothes, pretty much dead to the world. After a long moment,
she stirs.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> (<I>OS</I>) Hey ho, Sleeping
Beauty.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>very groggy; probably still feeling the
sedative</I>) Don' call me tha...<BR><BR>(<I>Pan for a wider view of the room
and see AP sitting in Lynn's desk chair, putting a book down on the desk. He
gets up and brushes her bangs out of her face.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B>
(<I>gentle</I>) Y'okay?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>fighting grogginess and
losing</I>) Wh... why d'my shoulders hur...?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> (<I>from the
doorway</I>) CPR will do that.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>still groggy but catching
up with current events</I>) Uhgod... she's okay?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Fine.
(<I>beat</I>) I'm hoping you're lucid enough to take orders and ... relaxed
enough to do it without too much of an argument.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>sitting
up slowly; waking up properly now</I>) I want coffee ... and I want an
explanation.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Coffee we can do. Report's going to have to
wait until we're on the road.<BR><BR>(<I>Pause as Lynn looks at
him.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>swinging her legs over the side of the
bed</I>) Start the coffee. I'll start packing.<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: on the
road. Music: Pearl Jam -- "Rearviewmirror". Warlock in shotgun seat of the bigwhitevan, on the phone.</I>)
<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Report.<BR><BR><B>Lehrer:</B> (<I>OS from phone</I>)
Alright, I've got GPA Girl, Captain Sanity, Miss Manners and the Ranger.
<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Any problems with the parents?<BR><BR><B>Lehrer:</B>
(<I>OS</I>) I took care of th' lot of it. So now wha' do we
do?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Find somewhere and go to the mattresses.
<BR><BR><B>Lehrer:</B> (<I>OS</I>) And if they come after
us?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> I hope it won't come to that (<I>beat; his eyes flit
closed briefly</I>) but if it does, sell yourself dearly.<BR><BR>(<I>Warlock
hangs up and puts his phone back on his belt -- at which point, it rings again.
He picks it up, flips it open.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B>
Yeah?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>OS</I>) We are stopping
<B>here</B>.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Peril, we...<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>OS</I>)
We need to <B>stop</B>. We're running on no food and less information and if you
<B>don't</B> let us stop and get what we need ... we're just ditching
you.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Peril, that's not advisable. You remember that
people are hunting you?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>OS</I>) At this point, I'm past
caring. And so are most of the rest of us. Stop or you'll have to track us down
and drag us behind you with tow chains.<BR><BR>(<I>Warlock's phone goes dead.
Warlock sighs and turns to Scar, who's driving.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Scar:</B> What's
<B>that</B> about?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> There's a rest area in a mile or so.
We're stopping there.<BR><BR><B>Pagebert:</B> (<I>from the back</I>) Should we
really do that?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Unless you can track their cars from back
there, I don't see we have any choice.<BR><BR><B>Pagebert:</B>
(<I>thoughtful</I>) I'll work on that when we stop. <BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene:
Roadside picnic area. Music: New Order -- "Crystal" [album version -- full intro]. Warlock, Pagebert and Scar are climbing out of BWV. The
Merc pulls up in a parking space next to them and disgorges Daria, Jane, Lynn
and AP. Tom, Angier and Quinn [who looks extremely pissed off] pull up a few
spaces down in the Rustbucket, and the A-Tank parks next to it a moment later.
As Trent, Jesse, Nick and Max exit, Lynn stalks up to Warlock with a really put
out look. Daria, Jane and AP are right behind her.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B>
Warlock. We've been on the road for hours. I want answers.
Now.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> (<I>tired, dry humour</I>) So do
I.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> WARLOCK...<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> I wouldn't test her, man.
Last two hours, it's been nothing but Methods. Methods I haven't even
<B>heard</B> of. And they all sound really, <B>really</B>
nasty.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> I notice that didn't stop you from helping,
though.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Hey, look, I may not like the 'rents all that much but
when someone comes up to 'em and...<BR><BR><B>Scar:</B> Could you think of some
<B>other</B> way to make them let you go?<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Listen, lady, <B>no
one</B> terrorises my parents. That's <B>my</B> job.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> And
mine, when he needs to double-team. But we're off the subject here, Warlock. I
want <B>answers</B>.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> I'll give you what I know. But you
were the one complaining about lack of food.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> On behalf of
the band, yes.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> We heard their stomachs growling from two
cars away. Over Rammstein.<BR><BR><B>Max:</B> (<I>OS</I>) Hey, can we eat? I'm
<B>starved</B>!<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> (<I>*sigh*</I>) Okay, Scar, take the
Musicmen and go get some food. (<I>Scar nods, heads towards the A-Tank, where
the band is congregating.</I>) Rest of you -- stretch your legs, whatever, but
<B>stay together</B>. No one wanders off alone.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Excuse me.
Given that we left with the approximate speed and organisation of a Polish fire
drill, what are the odds that someone followed us out of
Lawndale?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Higher than you think.<BR><BR>(<I>They look at
him. He looks back, impassive. They walk off a ways, and Quinn joins
them.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Okay, <B>someone</B> is going to tell me what is
going on, like, <B>now</B>! Do Mom and Dad know we're gone? Why are we out here?
Where are we even <B>going</B>? And Daria, are you okay? When they brought you
to the house with the really weird decorations, you looked like you were... I
mean, <B>GOD</B>, Daria...<BR><BR>(<I>With that, Quinn hugs Daria, who looks
more than a little shocked. She waits for a moment, though, before pulling
away.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> I'm okay, Quinn, thanks. As for Mom and Dad,
apparently they were told that we were spending Christmas with <B>my</B> family.
Which, in a way, is unfortunately true.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> But why would
<B>I</B> spend Christmas with <B>your</B> ... people? I mean, Christmas is a
<B>family</B> holiday!<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> You sound like Mom. And possibly so
that they could have some time to themselves. We've <B>both</B> been acting
strange since the summer.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Daria, you've <B>always</B> acted
strange.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Okay, can we stop the sibling crap for just two
minutes? She asked some other halfway-decent questions too.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B>
We're out here 'cos those ... those <B>freaks</B> we did nasties to last time
tried to kill the Twin Terrors! And we're going ... east? (<I>beat</I>) Why're
we going east?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> ... I think <B>I</B> know. We're going back
to Mississippi.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> What, you mean that place with all the seafood
where the Tank blew up?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> And it's a sick, sad thing when all
you can remember of a state is how someone tried to kill you in
it.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Hey, give the guy some credit. (<I>beat</I>) He
remembered the food, too.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>*sigh*</I>) Yes, the Gulf
coast, where the Tank got bombed, AP got his face mashed in with a tenderising
mallet and we did more shopping than gig-playing. We have ... friends
there.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> And when Mafia people say that, I come over all ...
shuddery.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> What <B>kind</B> of friends? I mean, we saw you
with people in Texas and we saw you with people in Pittsburgh and we saw you
with people in New York and <B>duh</B> we saw you with people in San Francisco
but we never saw you with <B>anyone</B> but <B>us</B> in...<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B>
When you went out the night the Tank blew up. You were ... taking care of
business, weren't you?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Not <B>exactly</B>. I was conning
money out of Dad to pay for the damages to the van, the instruments and our
wardrobes. But the guy who's out there does some other things than hiding the
money. He's a shelter -- I figure we're headed for his casino resort hotel. And
when we get there, depending on what Warlock has to say, I am going to get in
touch with Dad and we are going to have <B>words</B>.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Are
you sure that's wise?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> He's our father and he's letting this
happen to us. Do you think that's right? Is that something Jake Morgendorffer
would do? Or Fred McIntyre? Angier Sloane? Even Vincent Lane?<BR><BR>(<I>The
quintet look at each other; it's obviously hurting them to hear it as much as
it's hurting Lynn to say it. In near unison, they lower their heads in grim
acknowledgement. Smash cut to -- and end music on...</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: generic office setting. Kes walking
among the cubes, carrying a small pile of papers, dressed in black blazer, black
skirt and sensible black shoes -- blend-into-the-background tempwear. Her hair
is tied back. A man we recognise as Mitchell from earlier is walking past her in
the opposite direction. They nod casually at each other, as colleagues. Kes then
disappears through a door.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: the office [obviously a
high-up in the company]. We recognise it as the one DJ was brought into in our
first scene. Norton's inside, and he looks up at Kes as she drops the pile of
paper on the desk.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Kes:</B> (<I>accent now decidedly more
American</I>) Those files you wanted, Mr Norton.<BR><BR><B>Norton:</B> Thank
you. Any trouble getting them?<BR><BR><B>Kes:</B> Nope. I'm pretty good at
getting that kind of thing.<BR><BR>(<I>Norton nods at her and goes back to his
computer. Kes, without another look, walks out.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene:
roadside rest area, at the picnic tables. Music: resume New Order's "Crystal" from where we left off. Daria, Jane, Lynn, AP and Quinn are
sharing a couple of picnic tables with Tom and Warlock. The others are
relatively nearby, but there's enough space between them to create an illusion
of privacy for the group. The entire group are staring at
Warlock.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Don't tell us you didn't expect the Spanish
Inquisition.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> I mean, who's in <B>charge</B> now? Those
guys...<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Like I told you -- you can't kill a crime family
just by killing a few people in it, even the head people.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> So
who's in charge now? From what I've heard, Merritt's son is far too young and
Jensen's only family is ... independent.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Currently at the
head of things is Bryce Merritt's cousin, Brett Norton.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Oh,
the Ram. And let me guess; Wedge is the Consigliore. (<I>at Warlock's nod</I>)
Figures. Still stays in the family, no matter what you do.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B>
Not that I'm not grateful for a sudden evacuation from Barksdale family feuding
and Lawndale boredom in general, but I would like to know what promted
it.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Okay. The other morning, I was woken up by a pair of
phone calls. One was Leopard, up in New York.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B>
And?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Falcon and Number One missed a meeting with her. So
she did some digging. She found One's body in a morgue.<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> Uncle
Adam's dead?!<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Yeah.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> (<I>aside to
whoever's listening</I>) Even when the man's <B>serious</B> he makes those
wretched puns. (<I>to the looks</I>) You know ... digging... (<I>the looks get
worse; she sighs</I>) That was probably in bad taste.<BR><BR>(<I>Emphatic nods
all around.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> What about Dad? (<I>to Warlock's look</I>)
This is not the time, Warlock -- he's my father and I'm not going to bullshit
around with his codename if something's wrong.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> He's
missing. Not confirmed dead. But here's where it gets REALLY bad. Leopard says
the shot that did (<I>beat, small choke</I>) Adam in came from Falcon's weapon.
At close range -- powder burns on him.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>she can't -- or
won't -- believe it</I>) How?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Falcon's weapon was this
silly Russian chambering. I trust Leopard. She sold it to
him.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> So, you're saying Jer.... uh, Falcon shot
Adam?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Him, or someone using his weapon. There're about
five scenarios, and I like none of them.<BR><BR>(<I>Stunned
silence.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> The other call was Slack, in Biloxi. He
hasn't heard from Kestrel since she bugged out of SF. Put that together with the
fact that someone on the other side obviously knows stuff they
shouldn't...<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Are you suggesting
JAN...<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> I...<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> I'm not listening to
this.<BR><BR>(<I>She stands up and walks towards the Merc. Daria gets up and
follows her; Jane and AP take the time to glare at Warlock before doing the
same. Warlock drops his head on the table. His phone
rings.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Warlock.<BR><BR><B>Chopper:</B> (<I>OS</I>)
Warlock? Chopper.<BR><BR>(<I>Warlock gets up and wanders away. Tom and Quinn
look at the remnants of their meal and then share a
look.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> And <B>we're</B> stuck doing the cleaning
up?<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> You get used to it. Welcome to the bottom of the totem
pole.<BR><BR>(<I>Tom picks up some of the trash on the table, gets up and heads
for a garbage can. Quinn stares after him.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> But ... I'm
<B>always</B> the popular one... (<I>yelling</I>) Hey, <B>wait</B>! What do you
<B>mean</B>, <B>bottom</B> of the totem pole?!?<BR><BR>(<I>She grabs some
garbage without even thinking, gets up and jogs after Tom. Cut to Warlock,
talking into his phone some distance away from the picnic
tables.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> (<I>slight tenseness</I>) Have you tracked
him down yet?<BR><BR>(<I>Split-screen to "Chopper" -- heavyset man with black
hair.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Chopper:</B> Cost me two good people, but
yeah.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Get in touch with Eco and gather the forces. That
place needs to be hit.<BR><BR><B>Chopper:</B> (<I>thought VO</I>) Who the hell
does this kid think he is? (<I>aloud</I>) I'll set things
up.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> (<I>hears the reluctance</I>) If nothing else, they
probably have one of our assassins captive.<BR><BR><B>Chopper:</B> How do you
know?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Never mind! Just do it!<BR><BR>(<I>Chopper debates.
On the one hand, he does <B>not</B> appreciate Warlock giving him orders. On the
other, he does appreciate the opportunity to fight.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Chopper:</B>
(<I>slight sarcasm</I>) Yes. Sir.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Good.<BR><BR>(<I>He
slaps his phone shut and heads for the rest of the group, who are congregated by
the cars -- the picnic mess is cleared.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Scar:</B> Fed, watered,
present and accounted for.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Good. Let's
roll.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>from a small huddle with Daria, Jane and AP</I>)
No.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> (<I>*sigh*</I>) Peril...<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> NO,
damnit. If you really believe what you're saying, part of this is going to turn
into hunting Jan down. I'm not going to be part of that. She's no damn
traitor.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> If you'd let me finish... (<I>pause; Lynn
inclines her head in a 'go on' motion</I>) ...I don't think Kes is a traitor. Of
the five or so scenarios, it's the least likely one as far as I'm
concerned.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> But...<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> My best guess is
she went deep cover to try to crack a Merritt operation. The main reason I'm
concerned is that, if we have a leak, her cover might not just be blown. It
could be nonexistant.<BR><BR>(<I>Off their reactions, smash cut to...</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: Norton's office, after hours. Music: Godhead -- "The Reckoning". Click
as the lock gets picked, door opens. Kes enters, switching on the lights as she
does, and then closes the door behind her and sits at the desk, switching on the
computer and then setting to work picking the drawer lock as she waits for the
computer to boot. Then she types in a username ... thinks, then types a
five-letter password and hits enter. She gets in.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Kes:</B>
(<I>back to British; under her breath</I>) "Merit". How bloody
predictable.<BR><BR>(<I>She opens the e-mail programme and starts sifting
through the sent file. She takes a floppy disk out of her pocket and inserts it
into the machine, exporting mail files. Then she sees one that obviously hits
her hard -- she winces and nearly gasps. Then she exports it and starts logging
off.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Kes:</B> (<I>taking disk out and pocketing it again</I>)
Mission accomplished.<BR><BR>(<I>She takes a quick sift through the desk drawer
she's opened, ignoring the gun inside, and then shuts it, relocks it and makes
for the door. Just before she reaches it, it's opened and Refugee stands there,
flanked by goons.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Refugee:</B> (<I>sadistic grin</I>) Kestrel.
Heeeeeeeeey...<BR><BR>(<I>Kes gets an oh-shit look as he drags her out into the
hall.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: corridor. Music plays on. Kes is still being dragged by one arm
down the corridor. It's narrow, so Refugee's goons are behind him, double-file.
As they pass a random cube, Kes grabs a potted spider plant from the desk and
goes upside his head with it. He staggers and she runs for it, knocking over a
cube partition as she goes to block the path, buying her
time.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Refugee:</B> HE--... oh, screw it.<BR><BR>(<I>He pulls a
gun and *bang*, Kes lets out a half-stifled scream and goes down. He wipes dirt
off his face, moves the partition back to its proper position and walks up to
Kes, who's bleeding and in obvious pain but still
conscious.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Refugee:</B> 'Night.<BR><BR>(<I>And with that, he
pistol-whips her. Slam to black.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: random motel room,
night. Music: Ani DiFranco -- "Overlap". Daria and Lynn are in bed, but neither are sleeping. Both are, in fact,
lying on their backs, staring at the ceiling.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B>
Lynn?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Yeah?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> ... What do you know about
... Jan, Kes, whatever?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Well, she was sort of the first
Smythe to visit at Thanksgiving. Along with Lorna -- I guess she was just in St
Chris by then and needed the company. She insulted the crap out of my
mother.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> You two are ... close?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> As you
can be to someone who's always lived a good few thousand miles away from you.
(<I>beat</I>) She was good with presents the way Dad wasn't ... couldn't be, I
guess.<BR><BR>(<I>short silence</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> I keep thinking about
how I met her back in London. And I keep trying to make her fit the ... I don't
know, the profile. And I can't do it.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> She looks too
straight-edge, doesn't she?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Actually, I think her throwing
that guy's drugs out the window is what makes it hard.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> We
don't deal in that. And she's a medico -- anything heavier than pot offends her
sensibilities somehow.<BR><BR>(<I>beat</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> She's going to
be okay.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> And you know this how?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> I
don't. And I'm not very good at this "comforting people" thing. But I'm trying,
so be kind.<BR><BR>(<I>beat</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Thanks.<BR><BR>(<I>With
that, Lynn rolls over and pulls the covers over her head. Daria looks at the
ceiling for a moment longer.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>muffled</I>) We'll be
okay too. Or at least, you guys will. I'll make sure of it.<BR><BR>(<I>Daria's
eyes widen at that -- Lynn's obvious attempt at comforting fell very
flat.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> If you're not okay, <B>we're</B> not. You
<B>do</B> understand that, right?<BR><BR>(<I>Daria waits, but never gets an
answer.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Black screen. White writing reads "19 December,
2000". Fade up to...</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: darkened room. DJ sitting on the
floor when the door opens and Refugee appears in it.</I>)<BR><BR><B>DJ:</B>
(<I>snide</I>) Who do you think YOU are, Captain Rahim?<BR><BR>[footnote: The
Critic episode "Sherman of Arabia"]<BR><BR>(<I>He doesn't answer directly.
Instead, he gestures behind him and the two goons behind him drag a female
figure DJ can't quite make out at first into the room, dropping her
roughly.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Refugee:</B> This nosy bitch isn't very good company
right now, but take what you can get. (<I>to one of the goons</I>) Find our
medic. Let's see if he can't get a Kestrel to sing.<BR><BR>(<I>The door shuts
and DJ's eyes go big as she realises who she's now sharing a cell with -- and
the state of same.</I>)<BR><BR><B>DJ:</B> Kes? Ke-- oh
shit.<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: the Rustbucket. Music: Something for Kate -- "Electricity". Tom's driving, Daria's got shotgun,
and AP and Quinn are in the backseat.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> Is it safe to ask
why you asked to ride with me? I thought I was to blame for all
this.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Well, you <B>are</B>! Or at least you're a good
scapegrace! (<I>beat</I>) No, wait, that isn't right...<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> You
mean <B>scapegoat</B>, AP. And I wanted to ride with <B>you</B> because you're
in a position to help me with something. And, in turn, help
yourself.<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> (<I>wary</I>) And how do <B>I</B> need
help?<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Even <B>I</B> know this one. You have, like,
<B>no</B> pull with these people and you <B>obviously</B> need some or you're
going to get treated like ... well, like <B>you</B> for the rest of your
<B>life</B>! You <B>want</B> them to call you H forever?<BR><BR>(<I>Slight
pause. Tom's face is stone.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> What's the
position?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> You were given the job of safeguarding Lynn,
weren't you?<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> And you've been <B>crap</B> at
it!<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> ...I was <B>given</B> the job. And no particular training
for it, either. But I've been doing the best I could. So?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B>
With all this going on ... Lynn gave me the idea that she's set to go
kamikaze.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> ...Wait. That's the Japanese guys who did the
suicide bombing things in planes? (<I>Daria nods</I>) She <B>can't</B>! She
<B>wouldn't</B>! She ... oh. She <B>can</B>, she <B>would</B>, and she already
<B>did</B>. Crap.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> And <B>you</B>, Tom, should be trying to
<B>prevent</B> that, if at all possible.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Oh, <B>please</B>.
It's not like he has the first <B>clue</B> about her.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> You
<B>what</B>? You saw her more than <B>we</B> did, last spring! You've
<B>gotta</B> have <B>some</B> idea how she is and how she's gonna be,
right?<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Well, when <B>I</B> trained with him, he kept
complaining. You know, about how looking at Lynn's face is like trying to read
emotion in a brick <B>wall</B> or something. I guess he figured I'd understand
all that, being Daria's sister and everything, but come <B>on</B>, even <B>I</B>
can tell with her sometimes. When I feel like paying
attention...<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> Will you shut up, Narcissa? I was counting on
you to keep your mouth shut!<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> And the basis of your
reptuation with Warlock and the others suddenly comes clear.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B>
You trusted the gossip queen of Lawnhell to keep her <B>mouth</B> shut? You're
<B>stupid</B>!<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> But we're sidetracked. You're the one who
reminded me of the "hurricanes in her eyes" condition that affects her in times
of stress. What I'm asking you to do is simple. Watch for that and if you see it
... follow her. Keep her safe.<BR><BR>(<I>beat</I>)<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> You do
realise that agreeing to that is signing my own death warrant?<BR><BR><B>AP:</B>
Better <B>you</B> than <B>her</B>.<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> (<I>*sigh*</I>) And I
think Warlock would agree with you there. (<I>beat</I>) Why are you telling me
to do my job?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> We're not telling you to do it. We're
<B>reminding</B> you to do it.<BR><BR>(<I>Tom, saddened, just keeps
driving.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Establishing shot: casino in Biloxi. It's an
architechtural nightmare of a building with harsh angles, pastels and neon
signs, directly on the coastline. Music: The Yo-Yos -- "Home from Home". Lawndale convoy comes rolling into the entry
drive at the front.</I>) <BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: Slack's office. Music plays on. Enter Warlock,
followed by Daria, Jane, Lynn, AP and Quinn.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> I've seen
the convoy. (<I>beat</I>) All that? Just for my personal
problems?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Your personal problems and the Smythe business
problems are linked in some areas, Slack.<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> I noticed that,
yes.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Get the kids set up somewhere and I'll brief
you.<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> Sounds like a--<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> You mean WE'LL
brief him.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> You mean, you'll brief US.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B>
(<I>giving up</I>) There'll be briefings.<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> So they're
going--<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Will you people shut up and get me somewhere where
I can get a BATH?<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> Is she for--<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> At least
you finally noticed you <B>needed</B> one...<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> Now that's
just--<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> (<I>hits him</I>) Creep!<BR><BR><B>AP:</B>
ow...<BR><BR>(<I>Slack sticks two fingers in his mouth and blows an
ear-splitting whistle, getting everyone's attention.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B>
EXCUSE ME! I KNOW I'M ONLY YOUR HOST AND ALL, BUT COULD I BE PERMITTED TO GET A
WORD IN WEDGEWISE HERE? (<I>Silence -- and they're <B>all</B> staring at
him</I>) Thank you.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Was that really
necessary?<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> I don't have any fuel-air bombs on the premises.
It seemed like the only other way to get your attention. You've been through
some serious shit, haven't you?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B>
Indeed.<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> Well, you're forgiven then. For now, anyway. I'd
better go hold a Bavarian Fire Drill and free up some room space for your
passengers.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> I don't want anyone in a private room,
understood?<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> My security's not that bad,
Warlock...<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> I understand him -- we'll explain later. For now,
let's say Daria shares with Quinn, Jane with me, AP with
Rust...<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Purple <B>Peril</B>!<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Fine. Rust
can share a room with Remora, then. Trent, Jesse, Nick or Max. Take your
pick.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Aw, <B>jeeeeeeeeez</B> ... Sir Naps-a-Lot, then, if I
gotta.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>without missing a beat</I>) Nick, Max and Jesse
can squeeze into a room and the rest as they see fit. <B>They</B>, evidently,
can take care of themselves. (<I>beat</I>) So what do we do while we're waiting
for you to get things in gear?<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Look for my wayward brother
and his cronies, maybe?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> I think they found the
bar.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Great! We'll join them, then. I for one could
<B>use</B> something...<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Scarlet...<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B>
Oh, shut up.<BR><BR>(<I>And off they go. Warlock looks at Slack. Slack looks
back, shrugs and picks up the phone.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> (<I>into
phone</I>) Yeah, want to get Scooter in here? (<I>beat</I>) Sorry -- poorly
phrased. Get. Scooter. In here. I have a job for him.<BR><BR>(<I>Warlock's face
takes on a look that says, "I don't like this at <B>all</B>."</I>)
<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: bar. [Does it matter what it looks like? Most of the
patrons're probably too drunk to know, so why should we?] Music: Pearl Jam --
"Rats". Trent, Jesse, Nick and Max are seated at a table -- a great many beer
bottles stand on the table in front of them. They look
terrible.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Nick:</B> I feel like we dealt with the devil,
man.<BR><BR><B>Jesse:</B> What?<BR><BR><B>Max:</B> Take a look at it, you guys.
We find this kid -- she sings <B>damn</B> well, she plays, she manages, she's
hot...<BR><BR><B>Trent:</B> How many times, man? You missed your shot. She's
with the punk these days.<BR><BR><B>Max:</B> <B>Still</B> doesn't mean I can't
<B>look</B>! And don't talk to me about missing shots, okay? You and that thing
for Daria...<BR><BR><B>Trent:</B> Shut <B>up</B>, Max.<BR><BR><B>Nick:</B>
(<I>picking up the thread</I>) Anyway, we sign on this kickass singer with
connections, and then we find out what all those connections <B>are</B>. I mean,
living fast and dying young is one thing, but I got a
<B>family</B>!<BR><BR><B>Trent:</B> Nick, it's too late to be thinking like that
now. If we weren't in it when we first met Lynn, we were in it when we went into
that place in California armed to the teeth and looking to rescue her. Anyway,
could you <B>really</B> turn your back on her now?<BR><BR><B>Jesse:</B> And
Jane's in it.<BR><BR><B>Max:</B> <B>And</B> your Daria.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B>
(<I>OS</I>) Sorry -- I wasn't shown my ownership papers. Whose am
I?<BR><BR>(<I>They all turn [Trent blushing madly] to see Daria, Jane, Lynn,
Quinn and AP approach.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Trent:</B> Hey Daria. Janey. Lynn. Punk.
Daria's sister.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> I don't know which is worse -- "Narcissa"
or <B>that</B>.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Are they going to give us hassle over
drinking here?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Not if I go. I've been here before, remember?
Who wants what?<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> What's that peach stuff we had that time?
With Jodie and that creepy Goth girl?<BR><BR>(<I>AP winces. Lynn looks at him
quizzically.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> He ... had a bad experience with the
stuff at Biers.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Just ... nothing lethal?<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B>
The exact <B>opposite</B> of what he wants.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> I'll have what
you're having.<BR><BR><B>Trent:</B> You shouldn't go alone.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B>
What is <B>with</B> you people -- we're in one of <B>our</B>
places.<BR><BR><B>Trent:</B> Still. Jess?<BR><BR>(<I>Jesse stands up; Lynn sighs
and lets him accompany her. Daria, Jane, Quinn and AP drag over chairs and sit
down.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> That was nice, Trent. Very ... much like what a
caporegime would do, but nice.<BR><BR><B>Trent:</B> Thanks, Daria. (<I>beat</I>)
But what's a...?<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> A capo's sort of a guy who runs a piece of
a crime family. Answers to the Don, but leads a lot of little guys.
(<I>beat</I>) Or not-so-little, in Jesse's case.<BR><BR><B>Trent:</B> Oh. Right.
(<I>beat</I>) So what's going on? So far, we know jack.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B>
Well, we're sort of thrown by what little we know ourselves. But the basics go,
we're being hunted by the Merritts, who have picked <B>now</B> to make a move on
the Smythes. (<I>beat</I>) Tom's uncle is dead. DJ, Kes and ... Jerome ... are
missing, maybe dead. And one of them's a traitor and they don't know
who.<BR><BR>(<I>There is silence at the table.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Trent:</B>
Shit.<BR><BR><B>Nick:</B> This is <B>dumb</B>! They oughta <B>know</B> this
stuff! It's <B>their</B> organisation!<BR><BR><B>Max:</B> Yeah; I thought
criminales knew it <B>all</B>.<BR><BR><B>Trent:</B> How're you holding up? I
know that Jerome guy...<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Oh, please. I barely know him, and
my only real ties to him are genetic and ... dangerous.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> It's
Purple Peril you oughta be worried about. She's not showin' it, but she's
freaked.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> We're <B>all</B> freaked, AP.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B>
But <B>you're</B> not gonna go medieval on their asses with sharp things and no
backup, <B>are</B> you?<BR><BR>(<I>beat</I>)<BR><BR><B>Nick:</B> She's not gonna
<B>do</B> that, is she?<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Not if we can stop
her.<BR><BR>(<I>Lynn approaches, followed by Jesse. Her hands are empty of
drinks.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Word at the bar. We have rooms and there's a
meeting. Daria, you're with me. The rest of you, hit reception for rooms. AP'll
fill you in on who's sharing with whom.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> But
Purp...<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> You're the one with the memory. Please,
AP.<BR><BR>(<I>AP grudgingly nods. Daria stands and follows Lynn out of the bar.
The others all look at AP.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B>
Uuuuuuuuuuukay...<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: Slack's office. Music: Tool -- "Useful Idiot". Slack is seated behind
his desk; Warlock is in a chair opposite. Daria and Lynn enter and stand near
the door.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> So, now that they're here, what's on your
mind besides your hat?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> (<I>utmost scorn</I>) Ha. We have
a situation. <BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> Specifics, please. Generalities make my teeth
itch.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Well, for starters, there's a minor question as to
whether my cousin's a traitor. <BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> I explained that, Peril.
<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> I should hope you did, mister. <BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B>
Bitterness dies hard. You know that. <BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> I know <B>all</B>
about that. (<I>rubs itching left foot</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> There's a
leak within the Family. And there's reason to believe that Kes is gathering
information on that leak under deep cover. <BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Oh yeah. And if
you're right, that leak blew her cover. <BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> Fuuuck.
<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Adam was last seen in a NYC morgue, and the Falcon is
missing. <BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> Jesus. If they can get to the Falcon, they
<B>must</B> have inside info. <BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> There are four main
members of the Family dead, missing or both. And an attempt was made on those
two. (<I>gesture at Daria and Lynn.</I>) They're here because this is the
closest friendly place we could find. <BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Would have been
Texas, but the Rat met an exterminator.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Or twelve.
<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> A hit is planned on a Merritt stronghold in Michigan. We
have reason to believe that at least one of our people are alive in
there.<BR><BR><B>Lynn/Slack:</B> (<I>unison</I>) Kes? <BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B>
Unspecified. It might be Kes. It might also be DJ.<BR><BR>(<I>Daria and Lynn
exchange looks.</I>) <BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> Zoinks.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> That's
the briefing as it stands. Any questions?<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> Are these kids
being stashed here to await the rescue mission, or to keep them out of its
way?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> The latter.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> To my extreme
disappointment.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Lynn...<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> We need them
alive at all costs. We're the Family's present; <B>they're</B> its
future.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> No one seems to ask if we <B>want</B> to be this
Family's future...<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> The Peril seems to have already made up
her mind. Mostly, anyway. If you want out, feel free to start
running.<BR><BR>(<I>Lynn, without preamble, just marches out, slamming the door
behind her.</I>) <BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> What brought that
on?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Nice move, <B>Zedd.</B> We're still trying to talk her
out of that decision you seem to assume she's already made.<BR><BR>(<I>She slams
out too. Warlock gives Slack a <B>look</B> as Slack stands there,
nonplussed.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> (<I>bad cockney accent</I>) And for my
next trick, I will swallow my other foot.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> You run a
casino. I thought you needed diplomacy for that.<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> I'm the
Head of Special Accounts. I got kicked into the books <B>because</B> of my
amazing people skills.<BR><BR>(<I>Beat as Warlock glares at, then dismisses
Slack.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> This is all need-to-know. If I think you need
to know, I'll tell you. <BR><BR>(<I>Warlock starts to leave, but as he opens the
door.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> One more thing.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B>
(<I>stops, doesn't turn</I>) Yes? <BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> I may have to send
somebody to Hel for punching her ticket to Valhalla. Help me make sure it's the
<B>right</B> somebody.<BR><BR>(<I>Warlock nods and walks out. Slack rubs his
foot some more. He hikes up his pant leg and rolls down the sock, and we can see
that the foot, and the calf it attaches to, are prosthetic. He sighs loud and
long.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: corridor. Music plays on. Lynn's waiting for an elevator. It
<B>ping</B>s and the door opens. She steps in and hits a button. The doors are
closing as Daria approaches but she thrusts her arm between the closing doors
and the sensors kick in; the door opens again. Daria steps in and looks at Lynn
harshly as the door shuts again.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: lift. Music plays on. Daria is still
looking harshly at Lynn. After a moment, she speaks.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B>
So have you? Made your choice?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Overall, probably not. For
the time being, yes.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Lynn...<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> They might
have my cousin under suspicion of espionage. You don't know what they do to
prisoners.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> ...I thought you didn't
remember.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> The less you know, the better. You have enough
nightmare fuel.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Are you talking about this, or the two
morons from Highland?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> I don't know. Which makes it harder
for you to sleep at night?<BR><BR>(<I>There's a pause as Daria mulls this
over.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> It's too close to call.<BR><BR>(<I>Lynn gives
Daria a slightly amazed chuckle and the doors ping
open.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: 'holding cell'. The door opens; DJ glares at
the new arrivals -- Refugee, two mooks and a mid-height man with sandy blond
hair who, despite his youth, looks very much like a medical type. He scans the
cell and, after glancing briefly at DJ [she looks at him blankly], his eyes fall
on Kes.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Medic:</B> Dear lord...<BR><BR>(<I>The medic rushes over
to Kes, kneels and looks her over. Refugee watches impassively for a moment,
then gets impatient.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Refugee:</B> So what's the verdict, McLain?
Can you patch her up enough to let us grill her?<BR><BR><B>McLain:</B> She's a
human being, not a ... a ... fraying pair of jeans! She needs more medical
attention than I can give -- hospital care -- or she is going to
die.<BR><BR><B>Refugee:</B> (<I>shrug</I>) She's a Smythe... you think we
care?<BR><BR>(<I>DJ shrinks back a little,
unconsciously.</I>)<BR><BR><B>McLain:</B> But if she dies before ... (<I>checks
her breathing</I>) Oh hell... (<I>looks up; total command mode</I>) I need a
laminated card -- credit card or library card or something -- and a roll of duct
tape, STAT! (<I>he gets looks</I>) You heard me; MOVE!<BR><BR>(<I>He's a doctor;
used to being obeyed. They're mooks. Someone produces duct tape and Refugee
himself produces a library card -- date on it says it expired in 1987. McLain
cuts Kes' shirt away from the wound, cleans the area as best he can, then slaps
the library card into place and tapes it over the wound. He checks Kes'
breathing again and sighs with some relief.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Refugee:</B> Does it
talk?<BR><BR><B>McLain:</B>
(<I>bitter</I>) No. SHE lives. And not even THAT for long.<BR><BR>(<I>His
Hippocratic Oath thus reduced to meaninglessness, McLain exits -- probably, as
always after dealings with Refugee, grateful for his <B>own</B>
life.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Black screen. White writing reads "20 December, 2000".
Fade up to...</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: Daria and Quinn's room. Music: PJ Harvey -- "Big Exit". Daria's side is
spotless -- she sits on her bed and reads a book. Quinn's side looks like a bomb
hit her luggage -- she's fussing with her hair. Quinn turns around and looks at
Daria with some scorn.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> How can you <B>do</B>
that?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> (<I>not looking up</I>) Well, unlike you, who nearly
had to be beaten with a stick to learn to read, I learned on my own when I was
three.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> You know what I mean! How can you <B>read</B> at a
time like this?<BR><BR>(<I>Daria holds up the book -- "Cabin Fever -- How to
Cope with Siege Conditions".</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> At least I'm doing
something useful.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Daria, <B>look</B>. If I'm going to die
in this mess that ... that Lynn freak got us into, I'm at least going to leave a
pretty corpse. I have a reputation!<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> (<I>rolling her
eyes</I>) If I believed in a god, I'd be praying for deliverance right about
now.<BR><BR>(<I>There's a knock on the door. Daria looks up, a little
surprised.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Go <B>away</B>!<BR><BR>(<I>The door opens
and Lynn, Jane and AP poke their heads through.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Sorry,
Princess, but we automatically do the opposite of everything you want us
to.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Ugh!<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> And to what do I owe the
interruption?<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> You remember the strip
malls?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> I remember the short-shorts.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> All
they got's a Radio Shack but what the hey, it's better than nothing,
right?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> You're not suggesting we go <B>out</B> there, are
you? It's more <B>Quinn's</B> job to risk her life for the sake of a shopping
spree.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Relax, Daria. There won't be any repeats of
Pittsburgh.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Your near-suicidal self-confidence is always
going to amaze me, you know.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Not like <B>that</B>, Erudite
Emerald! It's just she's been up to her ol' tricks again!<BR><BR>(<I>Daria
thinks about this for a minute, and then outright stares at
Lynn.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> You bugged a Mafia family. And escaped
detection.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Hey, the FBI do it all the time, with other
families. And the word is that most of the fighting is happening a lot farther
north. And I could use a distraction.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Only you would see an
attempt to sneak out from under armed guard as "a
distraction".<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> And you wouldn't have me any other way. So are
you in?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> I don't know...<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Daria, would
you <B>really</B> rather spend the rest of the day sitting in here with the same
girl you've been trying to avoid ever since I've known you?<BR><BR>(<I>Silence.
Jane, Lynn and AP watch Daria expectantly, as does
Quinn.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> (<I>*sigh*</I>) Okay, I'm
in.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> HEY!<BR><BR>(<I>Daria gets off the bed and heads out.
Quinn watches, stunned.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Hey, wait! But ... what am
<B>I</B> supposed to do?<BR><BR>(<I>Tom appears in the doorway, looking a bit
nervous. Quinn looks at him.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> Uh, hi. (<I>beat</I>)
Bored?<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Yeah, <B>tell</B> me about it.<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> Uh
... there's a training room downstairs. Feel like venting some of that
frustration by beating the living crap out of me?<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Sounds
good. Just let me find the right outfit...<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> Even when you're
about to sweat off about a pound of water weight, you still have to look your
best doing it?<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Oh, why do I <B>bother</B> with you
geek-people who don't understand the first <B>thing</B> about dressing
<B>right</B> for something! I <B>meant</B> gym clothes or
something!<BR><BR>(<I>Tom nods, turns, and then looks
back.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> Hey, where are the others?<BR><BR>(<I>Quinn
considers her reply for a moment.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> God, like I pay
attention! Downstairs or upstairs or wherever.<BR><BR>(<I>Tom accepts this,
shrugs and leaves, shutting the door behind him. Quinn shrugs, smiles and starts
digging in one of the piles of clothes.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: road,
establishing. Music: Cake -- "Satan Is My Motor". A dark green Ford roars down the road.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene:
Ford interior. Music plays on. Lynn driving, AP riding shotgun. Daria and Jane in the
back.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Whose car is this?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B>
Slack's.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Why not the Merc?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Just a
precaution. The Merc's a little conspicuous and I'm sure no one would want me
driving it outside a convoy.<BR><BR>(<I>slight pause</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> I
thought no one knew we were gone?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> They
don't.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Then how'd you get the... (<I>it hits</I>) You
<B>hotwired</B> it?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Of course I didn't hotwire it -- what do
you take me for? (<I>beat</I>) AP hotwired it.<BR><BR>(<I>Daria and Jane
exchange a look.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> (<I>picking up on it</I>) What? Just cos
I can't drive 'em, I can't <B>steal</B> 'em either?<BR><BR>(<I>Daria and Jane
just keep gawping at him.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: training room. Music: Catatonia -- "This Boy Can't Swim". Quinn and
Tom face off.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> Hey, what say we make this a bit more
interesting?<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Don't even <B>say</B> it. Last time someone
said <B>that</B>, that fat Goth chick Andrea suggested strip
poker.<BR><BR>(<I>Tom starts to blush a little.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> What,
you afraid you're going to lose to me? Don't tell me you're worried just because
you're not wearing matching underwear.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> <B>God</B>, no.
Just, come <B>on</B>, I've had at <B>lots</B> of boyfriends and you are
<B>not</B> who I want my first naked guy to be.<BR><BR>(<I>Tom blushes harder.
Quinn, realising what she's said, follows suit. For a moment, they can't meet
each others' eyes.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> I meant something a little different
than that. How about ... for every hit I score on you, you answer a question.
Completely honestly.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> What do <B>I</B> get for every hit I
score on you?<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> The immense satisfaction of seeing my face
contort with pain?<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Not good enough ...
Rust.<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> Five bucks?<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Deal.<BR><BR>(<I>As
she speaks, she lashes out with a fist and knocks him to the floor. He gets up
with a rueful look on his face.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> What the <B>hell</B> did
I let myself in for...?<BR><BR>(<I>He ducks a flying kick and drives a fist
towards her midsection.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: the training room. Music plays on. Hold on
the door as Warlock opens it to see Quinn and Tom sitting shoulder to shoulder,
dripping sweat and panting. Tom looks to be in serious pain. Quinn looks tired
but high on endorphins. Warlock looks at the two of them, eyebrow
raised.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> You two look ... busy.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B>
(<I>scorn</I>) Ew! Warlock-person, look, I'm not going to sit here and listen to
your ... inneeandoes?<BR><BR>(<I>Tom just blushes.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> I
was hoping to find the Peril. We have things to discuss. Seen
her?<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> She and Jane and that red-haired freak Daria used to
date showed up at the room and said they were gonna find something to <B>do</B>.
In case you, like, haven't noticed, it's <B>boring</B> in this
place!<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Tell me that this "something to do" involved them
staying in the building.<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> Warlock, she told me that they had
gone upstairs. Or downstairs. I think that covers "inside the
building".<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> I was asking <B>her</B>. Don't you think that
was a little <B>vague</B>?<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Look, they don't tell me
<B>everything</B>, okay? And it's not like I care what they do or
anything!<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> You cared enough to be deliberately vague about
where they were running off to. And we had the building searched -- they're not
<B>anywhere</B> here. So where did they <B>go</B>, Narcissa?<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B>
Stop badgering her!<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Guh-AWD, Tom, I can take care of
<B>myself</B>! (<I>to Warlock</I>) Look, <B>I</B> don't know really where they
went and even if I did, I wouldn't tell <B>you</B>. I don't really care about
that Lynn girl or the AP freak except that Daria likes them or whatever, but if
<B>she</B> wants to get away from <B>you</B> freaky people, then I think that's
<B>great</B>! And <B>especially</B> when she wants to go
<B>shopping</B>!<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> Sh-shopping?<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> And I'll
see <B>you</B> later so you can pay up!<BR><BR>(<I>She gets up and stalks out of
the room. Warlock looks after her, then turns to Tom and notes that Tom has been
following her progress with his eyes too. The eyebrow goes up
again.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Get cleaned up, H.<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B>
What?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> I want you to set the land-speed record for
showering; you should be outside in the parking lot in ten minutes. You know the
malls better than we do. You're going to help us find them.<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B>
Yessir.<BR><BR>(<I>Warlock stands there a moment as Tom picks himself up off the
floor with a wince.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> As for
Narcissa...<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> Don't push it, Warlock. Just
don't.<BR><BR>(<I>Tom pushes past Warlock and leaves. Warlock rolls his eyes and
reaches for his cellphone.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: shopping mall food court.
Music: Traditional mall Muzac. Daria, Jane, Lynn and AP are digging into their meals. Lynn has Chinese, Jane
has a burger, Daria has lasagne and AP has pizza. Silence reigns,
until...</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Don't you get enough of that at
home?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> That's kind of the point. (<I>beat</I>) Just don't
let it get out that I'm a little homesick. What I want to know is how AP managed
to make them make that pizza.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Hey, it's not the normal one.
They couldn't find capers <B>or</B> artichoke hearts so I kinda had to improv.
It's creamed corn and ladyfingers this time. Anyway, this one uses catfish
instead of tuna. (<I>to the looks</I>) I guess it's a Mississippi thing. It's
kinda good, though. Anyone want?<BR><BR>(<I>They all flinch back from the
offered slab of pizza.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Yeah, I want -- I want your head
examined. <BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Or perhaps your tongue.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B>
(<I>*smirk*</I>) I can attest to the fact that there is <B>nothing</B> wrong
with his tongue.<BR><BR>(<I>AP blushes so hard he looks like he's going to
spontaneously combust. Jane and Daria smirk at each other, and then Jane decides
to change the subject.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> If that thing tastes like it
smells, AP, you should have a biohazard warning slapped on that
tray.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Hey, Art-Smart Scarlet, opened your fridge at home
lately?<BR><BR>(<I>They all glare at him.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Yeah, I have,
AP. Telekinetically. From three-four states away.<BR><BR>(<I>AP finally realises
what he's said; his eyes go big and he crams his mouth full of pizza so there's
no room for his foot. More silence. Then Lynn raises her head, looks across the
room, and casually picks up her tray, which is still mostly
full.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Lynn, what are you doing?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B>
Making a strategic retreat. Look.<BR><BR>(<I>They all do; Lynn rolls her
eyes.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Way to be casual, people.<BR><BR>(<I>We see what
they see -- Warlock, Tom, Scar and Pagebert, standing by a mall
map.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Aw, dang. It might not be a whole <B>lot</B> of fun,
but Radio Shack was gonna be <B>way</B> better than seeing all the gear I'm not
allowed to play with at that stup...<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Go.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B>
Come again?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Go, but go via someplace they'd <B>never</B>
look for you. If we hang back for long enough, they'll start looking in the
<B>un</B>likely places long enough for us to do some time in the <B>likely</B>
ones. Now split up. If we're not caught, we'll meet at the car at
four.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> But...<BR><BR>(<I>But Lynn's gone. AP follows suit.
Daria and Jane look at each other.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Where would they
<B>never</B> look for us?<BR><BR>(<I>They look at each other ... and
sigh.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: "Coiffe Medicine" hair salon. Two figures are
seen under large driers -- they're hidden with magazines. After a moment, the
magazines are lowered and we see Daria and Jane. Neither of them look
impressed.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> (<I>a bit loudly</I>) Thirty-five dollars
to look like we've never been <B>near</B> this place. <B>Each</B>. And they
didn't bat an eye when we asked them to manage that. Does that strike <B>you</B>
as strange?<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> WHAT?<BR><BR>(<I>Daria sighs, rolls her eyes and
lifts her magazine again.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: jewellery storefront. Lynn
drifts past, peers in the window at something. Hold there for a moment. A young
man in a good suit comes out of the shop and looks at Lynn for a
moment.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Man:</B> Were you looking for something in particular,
ma'am?<BR><BR>(<I>Lynn looks at him a moment, then back into the shop window,
then sighs.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Nah. A bit fancy for my blood, if I'm
honest. Thanks anyway.<BR><BR>(<I>She walks off. The young man watches her
leave, then shrugs and starts back into the shop.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B>
(<I>OS</I>) Hey, mister, hold up!<BR><BR>(<I>The young man turns towards the
sound of the voice. AP careens into shot at a dead run, tries to stop, glides,
hits the shop window and collapses on the floor in a little heap. The young man
looks extremely confused.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Man:</B> Can I ... help you...
(<I>slightly overlong beat</I>) ...sir?<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> (<I>*groan*</I>) Well,
first you can help me off the floor...<BR><BR>(<I>The young man does. Once AP's
on his feet -- reeling slightly -- the young man gives him the
once-over.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Man:</B> Now ... was there something
else?<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Yeah. Can you show me what the girl was looking at? It's
kinda important.<BR><BR>(<I>Now the man looks <B>really</B>
dubious.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Man:</B> If you mean the girl in the purple jacket, I
sure can, but ... I think that's a little out of your reach...<BR><BR>(<I>AP
scowls at the man, then produces a wad of cash from his
pocket.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Mess ye not with techno-weasels, pencil-neck. You
get <B>real</B> embarrassed. Now you gonna tell me what she was looking at or
<B>what</B>?<BR><BR>(<I>The man's eyes are very large by now, and he looks at AP
with something like respect -- but not all that much like
it.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Man:</B> I'll show you, sir. If you want to come
inside...<BR><BR>(<I>The young man leads AP into the store as Tom and Warlock
turn a corner.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: Radio Shack, exterior. AP, stuffing a
small velvet jeweller's box into a jacket pocket, looks at the store and
sighs.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> (<I>aloud to himself</I>) Oh, how the geeky have
fallen.<BR><BR><B>Pagebert:</B> (<I>OS</I>) That's the problem with Southern
backwaters.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> GAH!<BR><BR>(<I>Pagebert approaches. AP looks at
him with big puppyish eyes.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Pagebert:</B> What were you after in
there, anyway?<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> You want truth? I didn't really know -- just
whatever hit me, y'know. Well, I need <B>something</B> to put together! Purple
Peril and Erudite Emerald can do word puzzles and stuff and Art-Smart Scarlet
can paint and draw and put together kitchen stuff and melt gummybears
and...<BR><BR><B>Pagebert:</B> I get the idea. (<I>beat</I>) Well, if I'm vague
about when I found you, I can probably give you fifteen
minutes.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Fifteen <B>minutes</B>? I'll <B>never</B> find
anything in ... ooh!<BR><BR>(<I>He nearly bounces into the store; Pagebert looks
after him, amused, and follows him.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: bookstore. Music: Moxy Fruvous -- "My Baby Loves a Bunch of Authors". Daria
has a large stack of books under one arm and is approaching the counter with a
list. She drops the books on the counter, under the amazed eyes of a slightly
scruffy clerk.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Clerk:</B> What, are you going into
quarantine?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Yes. The AMA has recently stated that stupidity
is contagious, so I'll lock myself in the storm cellar until the epidemic blows
over.<BR><BR>(<I>The clerk frowns at her for a moment, then turns his head and
calls out to an unseen party to the left.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Clerk:</B> Hey, dude,
this the one you're looking for?<BR><BR>(<I>Tom steps out from behind a nearby
shelf; Daria looks appalled.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> (<I>to Daria; slight
shrug</I>) Hey, it worked for Cullen, didn't it?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> What are
my chances of getting away from you by screaming "rape"?<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B>
Well, if you really feel like calling that much attention to
yourself...<BR><BR>(<I>beat</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> I say this to Jane, but I
<B>mean</B> it to you -- I really hate you sometimes.<BR><BR><B>Clerk:</B> Hey,
you going to buy those, or what?<BR><BR>(<I>They both <B>glare</B> at
him.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: CD shop. Jane's has an armful of CDs and is
consulting a list. She steps to the counter and dumps the armload, then looks up
at the sullen-looking saleslady.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> I'm still looking for
a couple of things. You got "Demons and Wizards"? Self-titled
album.<BR><BR><B>Saleslady:</B> Who?<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Never mind. Anything by
Iced Earth?<BR><BR><B>Saleslady:</B> We got Ice-T, Ice Cube and Vanilla Ice,
kid, but never heard of Iced <B>Earth</B>.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Pop Will Eat
Itself? Mercyful Fate? Therapy? Me Mom and Morgentaler?<BR><BR>(<I>The saleslady
looks more and more blank -- and more and more pissed-off -- with each band
listed.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Saleslady:</B> Look, what you see is what we got! Now you
gonna <B>pay</B> for those?<BR><BR><B>Scar:</B> (<I>OS</I>) You can track the
rest of it through Amazon. Like you should have done with <B>this</B>
stuff.<BR><BR>(<I>Jane turns to Scar's accusing face; her own countenance is set
in a near-exact imitation of the saleslady's -- sullen and pissed
off.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: video arcade. Music: Regurgitator -- "Superstraight". Close on Lynn, in firing stance,
with a pale blue plastic gun in her hand. Cut to what she sees -- she is
currently beating the unliving shit out of House of the Dead II. Warlock takes a
place at her side and watches her for a moment. Lynn never takes her eyes off
the screen, but...</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> It was too much to ask to let us
out; we knew that. So we didn't ask.<BR><BR>(<I>beat</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B>
You could have done this for real back at the resort.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Yes,
but I would have <B>had</B> to do this for real back at the resort.
(<I>beat</I>) I couldn't convince you to be briefly distracted by a game of
Silent Scope or some...<BR><BR>(<I>She trails off as Warlock just <B>looks</B>
at her.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> No.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Can you at
<B>least</B> let me finish my game?<BR><BR>(<I>Warlock looks at her for a
moment, then digs in a pocket. He produces coins, adds them to the player 2 side
and picks up the other gun.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> A different man would tell
me to enjoy this while it lasts because twenty-four hour lock-up begins the
minute we get back to the casino, right?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B>
Yyyyyyyyyyep.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Oh great. Out of parental supervision and I'm
<B>still</B> getting grounded.<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: Isle foyer. Music plays on. Daria, Jane,
Lynn and AP pile in carrying shopping bags and looking somewhat pissed off. They
are followed by Warlock, Scar, Pagebert and Tom, who have that stern parental
countenance.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Scar:</B> I've been talking to Pagebert about this.
There are such things as mp3s. And e-texts. And there's that little thing about
people out there...<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> (<I>to Scar, warning</I>) This is not
the place.<BR><BR><B>Scar:</B> Upstairs, you people. We need to have a
<B>talk</B>.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> You mean <B>you</B> need to have a bitch-rant.
Not interested.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> She's right. You took a big risk today. I
don't think you understand the situation.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> It's <B>you</B>
who doesn't understand. We know the situation better than you think we
do.<BR><BR>(<I>They are at the bank of elevators now, and waiting. Warlock looks
at Daria.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: Jane and Lynn's shared room. Music plays on. Warlock has
followed the girls in. He looks like he's fighting extreme irritation, and
losing.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> So we're telling you that we <B>know</B> that
most of the Southern Merritt operatives have been moved to Detroit, and those
who <B>weren't</B> are holed up in New Orleans somewhere. So Lynn figured that,
with that kind of lowered risk, going out to the local temple of capitalism was
about as safe as school's been for the last year. Possibly more
so.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> And you know this how?<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Boy,
<B>you're</B> a bright spark, aren't you? We know because Lynn
knew.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> (<I>levelling a <B>look</B> at Lynn</I>) And she
knew because...<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>epitome of casual</I>) I bugged Slack's
office. And a few other strategic points around the resort. You know what they
say about forewarned is forearmed.<BR><BR>(<I>Warlock just openly
stares.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> That should not be possible. Doesn't this
place sweep for bugs?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Not as far as I'm aware. Remember,
it's a remote outpost, of which Slack's in charge.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Look at
it this way. If you stopped keeping things so close to the vest, we wouldn't
have to resort to covert espionage. You have only yourself to
blame.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> This won't happen again.<BR><BR>(<I>With that, he
leaves. Silence for a moment.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Just reassure me of one
thing.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> What's that?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> No matter what he
does, no matter how bored we get, we will not resort to board
games.<BR><BR>(<I>AP rummages through the bags.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> We got
... King ... Moliere ... King ... Eugenides ... King ... Garland ... Coupland
... King ... Gaiman a whole bunch of <B>other</B> people I never heard of...
Y'know, I don't think you got a lot to worry about on "stuff to do that isn't
board games".<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> You make a point. But what are <B>you</B>
gonna do?<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> (<I>holding up a Radio Shack bag; big grin</I>)
Build a better mook-trap?<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> (<I>at one of the end tables,
where a boom box sits</I>) Music to irritate?<BR><BR>(<I>Daria, Jane and AP
share a look.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: corridor. A young man who looks just
like Radar O'Reilly wheels a room service trolley towards Jane's room. At which
point he is hit by the opening chords of "Rise Up" by Skunk Anansie, blaring at
nosebleed-inducing intensity. He starts, then runs the trolley up to Jane's
door, hammers on it for a second, then runs away.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>scene: the
improv prisoner cell. Music plays on. The room is dimly
lit, reducing DJ and Kes to vague shapes on the floor. Kes is still sprawled out
on the floor. DJ, seated in the corner, is wriggling.</I>)<BR><BR><B>DJ:</B>

the room's negligible contents.</I>)<BR><BR><B>DJ:</B> (<I>musing</I>) Weapon
... weapon... <BR><BR>(<I>The door opens, letting in a bar of light. A
silhouette appears in the doorway. DJ flattens herself against the nearest wall,
barely breathing.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Mitchell:</B> Hello Smythes. (<I>*snick-clack*
as he loads and chambers a semiauto.</I>) Your friends are here to see you. Too
bad you can't come out and play.<BR><BR>(<I>He steps further into the room and
points the semi-auto at Kes, still sprawled motionless on the floor. DJ lashes
out with her foot, knocking the weapon away into the wall. She spins, kicks him
in the head, and then in the groin. He slams into the wall, she scoops up the
gun and double taps him. As he falls dying, she turns to face Kes, when...</I>)
<BR><BR><B>Aph:</B> (<I>OS</I>) DROP THE WEAPON! NOW!<BR><BR>(<I>DJ does it, but
with a tired and amused look on her face.</I>)<BR><BR><B>DJ:</B> Aph, it's a
REALLY good thing I recognise your voice.<BR><BR>(<I>Aph steps out of the
shadows, gun out. She looks completely stunned.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Aph:</B> DJ!?
YOU'RE the assassin Warlock was ... no WONDER! (<I>noticing Kes on the
floor</I>) Ohmigod...<BR><BR><B>DJ:</B> (<I>leaning against the wall -- it's
been a rough few days for her</I>) You guys, like, need
backup?<BR><BR><B>Aph:</B> No, you just sit down. We've almost got things
covered outside and NCM knows some first aid -- he'll want to look you and Kes
over and...<BR><BR>(<I>Gunshots nearby; the voices of two VERY pissed-off East
Coasters drift to them.</I>)<BR><BR><B>N.C.M.:</B> (<I>OS; mocking tone hiding
grief</I>) Oh my GOD. You killed Eco!<BR><BR><B>Chopper:</B> (<I>OS; deadly
serious</I>) You BASTARDS.<BR><BR>(<I>Aph and DJ share a look and then, in
unison, raise their weapons and head for the door.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene:
Slack's hideout, Biloxi. Music: Alice in Chains -- "Confusion". AP steps into the doorway and then stops. Pan into the
room -- it's a bedroom. The bed nearest the door is unmade and a sketchpad lies
atop it -- Jane's, obviously. Lynn's sitting on the other bed, cleaning her gun.
AP frowns at this.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Hey ho, Purple
Peril.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>distracted by her task</I>) Hmm.
<BR><BR>(<I>Slight pause ... then AP gets a *ping* look.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B>
And now for a musical interlude!<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>raised eyebrow, still
not looking up</I>) 'Interlude'. That's an impressive word for
you.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Yeah, well, I guess that 'Word of the Day' website is
payin' off. Now do you want the music or not?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>still not
looking up</I>) Yeah, whatever.<BR><BR>(<I>AP turns away in thought, then clears
his throat but doesn't turn back to her yet -- can't face trying to sing face to
face with <B>her</B>, given her expertise.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> (<I>the only
lyrics he remembers</I>) o/` Your eyes cast a spell that be...o/` (<I>*rustle*
*thunk* from behind him; he turns, bewildered</I>) ...witches?<BR><BR>(<I>Pan to
what he sees. Lynn is curled up fetal in the corner on the bed, pale and
shaking. The gun lies forgotten on the floor. AP stares, unable to work out
what's happened.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> (<I>bewildered</I>) Purple Peril?
(<I>beat; worried at lack of response</I>) Lynn? (<I>beat; slightly more
panicked</I>) Lynn! (<I>Leans forward, reaches to touch her shoulder</I>) Lynn,
it's okay; it...<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> NO.<BR><BR>(<I>As she says this, she lashes
out with a foot; it's a totally uncontrolled move but it hits AP hard in the
shoulder nonetheless, knocking him over.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> (<I>muttering to
himself</I>) ...'s NOT okay; okay is the LAST thing this is... How do I put
this? (<I>beat</I>) SOMEONE GET THE HELL <B>IN</B> HERE!<BR><BR>(<I>Tom enters
the room and sees AP hauling himself into a sitting position as he rubs his
shoulder.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> What the hell happ...<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Get.
Warlock.<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> (<I>sees Lynn; eyes widen</I>) What's with HER?
I...<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Just shut up and get Warlock NOW.<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B>
Look, kid, I...<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> DO YOU NOT SPEAK
<B>ENGLISH</B>?<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> Okay, okay!<BR><BR>(<I>Tom exits at a run. AP
stays at a distance, watching Lynn closely, not daring to speak lest he screw it
up again.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: another bedroom in the Biloxi hideout.
Music plays on. Warlock is asleep on a bed [not in; <B>on</B>, as in on top of the covers and
fully dressed]. Tom barges in and Warlock sits up at the noise, readjusting his
glasses and looking at Tom with some irritation.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B>
(<I>nervous</I>) Warlock, we have a ... situation.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> What
<B>kind</B> of situation?<BR><BR>(<I>Off a squirming Tom, go
to...</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: Lynn's room, Biloxi. Music plays on. Warlock barges in to find
AP still on the floor, still staring at Lynn in some concern. Warlock takes this
in and keeps a distance from Lynn.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Peril.
(<I>beat</I>) Lynn. Three deep breaths. Stat. (<I>beat; the shaking's eased a
little.</I>) Lynn, calm down and see the way back. (<I>she seems to calm down a
little more</I>) Okay. H...<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B>
<B>Rust</B>...<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Now is not the time. Just get to her and
get her to lie down.<BR><BR>(<I>Tom approaches and reaches out for her. She
tenses up and lashes out again; a second later, Tom's on the floor as well.
Warlock sighs, sets down the case and opens it, taking out a tranquilliser gun.
He loads it, aims and fires; Lynn flinches, then slumps as the tranquilliser
takes hold. Warlock steps over to her and checks her pulse, then turns to the
two boys, who are getting to their feet.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> (<I>after
assessing them silently for a second</I>) ...You're okay. Get out of
here.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> NO! I want to find out what I did
<B>wrong</B>!<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> Warlock...<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> (<I>mild
rue</I>) I'm the amateur psychologist around here and what I say goes. Both of
you get out of here. Maverick... (<I>softens a little</I>) ...stick close
by.<BR><BR>(<I>With various degrees of reluctance, the two boys exit the room.
Fade out.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Fade in on the same room some time later. Lynn
opens her eyes; she still looks a bit pale and frightened, but coherent at
least. She sits up and looks at Warlock, who's still
nearby.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> How are you feeling?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Is
AP okay? I...<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Him and H are both fine. You didn't kick
them that hard.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>guilty as hell</I>) I thought it was the
same person twice.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Nopenope. (<I>beat</I>) What
happened?<BR><BR>(<I>Pause. Lynn looks at Warlock very dubiously ... then sighs.
If she can't tell him, after she's opened up to him in so many other instances,
she can't open up to anyone.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>slow and heavy</I>)
Let's just say that Lehrer is probably not a good idea.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B>
The Affilliate or...?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> No, not the
Affiliate.<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Flashback: Merritt compound prison area. Music plays on. Quinn is
bearing AP's weight, looking at Lynn as she's grabbed by Merritt's men. Lynn
looks straight into Quinn's eyes ... and Quinn frowns, seeing that something
isn't quite right...</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> GO!<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B>
(<I>resolute</I>) I'll bring help. I...<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Will you just get
OUT of... (<I>she is injected and slumps into her captor's arms</I>)
...ah...<BR><BR>(<I>Quinn flees as quickly as she can under AP's nearly
unconscious weight. Merritt turns to Jensen, who's dusting off the knees of his
suit.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Merritt:</B> Let's just see which one we actually
have.<BR><BR><B>Jensen:</B> It has to be the Peril, sir. The Erudite isn't known
for <B>that</B> kind of boldness...<BR><BR><B>Merritt:</B> The Erudite is barely
known at <B>all</B> yet, Jensen. (<I>he steps towards Lynn and pulls down the
collar of her yellow-orange T-shirt in the back until he can just see the head
of the shark tattoo on her left shoulder blade.</I>) That settles that. We have
the Peril. And as per our agreement ... carte blanche, Jensen. But eke it out
and get photographic evidence. <BR><BR>(<I>With that, Merritt exits without a
backward glance. Jensen gives a grin that would be nearly childish if it wasn't
so evil, and rubs his hands together excitedly.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jensen:</B>
(<I>manic</I>) Oh, GOOD! This one can take a punch! (<I>beat as he goes
thoughtful; then to the minions, hurriedly</I>) I need shrooms, strongest ones
you can get hold of ... at least six more ampoules of that stuff (<I>gesturing
to the empty syringe in one minion's hand</I>) ... a bottle of ipecac and
thirty-three blue M&amp;Ms. (<I>beat</I>) Oh, and the camera! (<I>to the
looks</I>) Don't ask questions; move! <BR><BR>(<I>The minions scarper. Jensen
bounces around the room cheerily.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jensen:</B> (<I>sings</I>) Oh,
I ache for the touch of your -- lips, dear / But much more for the touch of your
-- whips, dear... (<I>Lynn starts whimpering; Jensen looks over at her with a
widening grin. spoken</I>) Ooh. You don't like <B>that</B> much, do you, dearie?
(<I>singing</I>) You can raise welts/ Like nobody else...<BR><BR>[Endnote: "The
Masochism Tango" - Tom Lehrer ... and thanks to Austin for looking that up; I
kept meaning to add that...]<BR><BR>(<I>End flashback. Lynn is sitting up in
bed, hugging her knees, very pale. Warlock is watching her carefully. After a
moment, when he knows she's not going to take a swing at him, he puts a hand on
her arm. Pan to the doorway, where Daria and AP are peeking in, worried looks on
their faces. Then they fade out of the doorway as Lynn's voice drones
on.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: corridor. Music: Staind -- "Can't Believe". AP and Daria look somewhat
shell-shocked. There is a long silence.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> You're the one
with the words. <B>Say</B> something, Daria.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> What kind of
something?<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Something that makes that hurt
less.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> The only thing I can come up with is that at least
there's a rational explanation for how she's been since the
summer.<BR><BR>(<I>beat</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Doesn't help.<BR><BR>(<I>AP
starts walking. Daria follows him.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> All that time.
Three months at least. And she never said a word to any of us about it. She
locked it all up.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> D'you think you
could've?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> I would have tried. I would have wanted to. But
<B>that</B>... (<I>beat; then she shakes her head</I>) No. I'd have just fallen
apart.<BR><BR>(<I>Silence. They reach a doorway. AP opens the door, starts to
step into the room, then turns to look at Daria.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> I felt
bad, y'know? I felt like, fine, sure, maybe it wasn't so bad to have killed the
guy who did some really nasty crap to my ... well, to <B>her</B> ... but that it
really sucked to have actually killed a body. Y'know? Even just knowing what she
was like after, I still felt bad. And it's not that I don't feel at all bad
anymore, but...<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> You feel a little more justified, maybe?
Some of the things you heard helped to salve your conscience?<BR><BR><B>AP:</B>
In Geek-lish, please?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> There's a voice in your head that
you've had to argue with every day since you pointed that gun at Jensen's head
and pulled the trigger. It's told you that you committed a murder -- a crime of
passion, maybe, but that doesn't make ending someone's life right. And the other
parts of your mind argue with you that you had your reasons. What you just heard
gives that voice more ammunition.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Oh.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> I'm
not very good at making people feel better about much of anything. Actually, I
spent the best part of my childhood trying to make people feel <B>less</B>
comfortable about their positions in life. So this might come out ... well, like
something you might say.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Great! I might actually get it first
time for a change.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> I heard Warlock talking. He wasn't going
to let any of us on the front lines of this <B>before</B>. Now that he's hearing
Lynn's little horror story, the odds are high that he's going to take the fight
as far away from her, and consequently from the rest of us, as he can get
without taking it -- or us -- out of the country.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Some parts
of Purple Peril, you just don't wanna know, do you?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Excuse
me?<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> She doesn't <B>wanna</B> be taken out of the fight. She
had scores to settle when she <B>didn't</B> remember what the stupid goons did
to her, and now she <B>does</B>. You don't think she wants it <B>over</B>? I
mean, so she <B>knows</B> it's over, like her being right up at the front of
it?<BR><BR>(<I>AP shuts the door before Daria can even think about whether she
has an adequate response to that.</I>) <BR><BR><BR>(<I>Black screen. White
writing reads, "21 December 2000". Fade up to...</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene:
restaurant bar, Biloxi casino. Music: Tori Amos -- "Precious Things". A breakfast buffet has been laid out at the far
wall, and nearby, three large tables are occupied by most of the group -- Daria,
Jane, Lynn, AP, Quinn and Tom are at one table, the band are at another and the
third is occupied by Slack, Scar, Pagebert and Angier. Warlock steps into the
room and surveys everyone, getting the mood of the room before he
speaks.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> State-of-the-war update,
people.<BR><BR>(<I>Conversation -- such as it was -- dies, people turn towards
him.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Chopper led a strike against a Merritt
stronghold in Michigan. Some of you already knew about this. While we didn't get
Wedge, and lost Eco, (<I>moment's pause</I>) we managed to pull out DJ (<I>for a
second, the mask cracks and one can see relief on his face</I>) and Kestrel. And
we're pretty sure Kes knows who our leak is.<BR><BR>(<I>Of the group, Lynn looks
the most relieved, with Slack not far behind. Angier, however, has tried to
school his expression but winced a little anyway; pan across to Tom, who throws
a hard look at his father. Cut back to Warlock.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B>
Unfortunately, she had to go into surgery. She's going to make it, but for the
moment, we don't know exactly who said leak is. That is all.<BR><BR>(<I>Warlock
grabs a plate and loads up on food. Lynn and Slack, in near-choreographed
unison, stand and approach him; Daria sighs and follows suit. As Warlock turns
around with his plate, he sees the incoming questioners, sighs, and puts down
plate on the buffet table</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> No, that is <B>not</B>
'all'.<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> Yeah. I mean, <B>surgery</B>? What the haemorrhaging
fuck do you <B>mean</B>, surgery?<BR><BR><B>Daria/</B><B>Lynn:</B>
(<I>unison</I>) Well put.<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> Oh shit. How bad is
it?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> She'll live. Probably have nothing more than a scar
for her trouble.<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> Could be worse. At least <B>she's</B>
keeping all her limbs.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> That's supposed to be a comfort? What
the hell was she doing in that situation without backup?<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B>
'Damn if I know, Sarge,' he peed sarcastically.<BR><BR>(<I>They all glare at
him. Hard. He shuts up with a contrite look, not daring to say more ... for the
time being.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Lynn, you know that there's a leak
somewhere, yes? Kes was one of the few your father trusted implicitly.
<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Trusted enough to risk her life for the matter.
Wonderful.<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> She knew the risks, I guess. Not that it makes
me feel any damn better.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> We all did.
<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Yes; basically, we did. Frankly, we didn't have any choice
but to take them. Did she?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Lynn, how do you think I feel?
I was not one of those few, and now command has devolved on
me.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> You and the command deserve each other. You could show a
little concern for Kes.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Showing concern is bad for
morale. If I'm not worried, they're not worried.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> And it does
my morale all kinds of good to know that, if I went down, you'd be an
automaton.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> In public.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> It might do
morale better if you gave a damn about your ... well, whatever Kes is to you.
After all, they're not just co-workers, as far as I can
tell.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> (<I>obviously quoting</I>) Don't ever let your
people see you bleed. Don't ever let them see you hurt. Do-- (<I>stops in
mid-quote; damn near Vulcan</I>) Kes is to me about what you two were to each
other before you found out your lineage.<BR><BR>(<I>There is a long silence as
this sinks in. Lynn closes her eyes and keeps them closed. Daria looks from her
to Warlock, who looks back at her impassively, with large
eyes.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Oh.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> The word, you three,
is umsiblings.<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> And we are in an
umsituation.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Why am I not surprised an 'um;' would find
itself in there somewhere.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> And that's not funny,
Slack.<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> It was worth a try, I thought. Not really supposed
to be all <B>that</B> funny anyway.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Now. About this leak.
Any leads?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Any leads you can't give in public, at
least...<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Well, if one applies
logic...<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> (<I>comes over all Data</I>) Ah.
Indeed.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Slack, shut up and let's hear the
man.<BR><BR>(<I>Slack makes a zipper motion across his
lips.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> It has to be someone who was high enough up to
leak all this information.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> That narrows it down
some.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> And I guess Kes is fairly well alibied
now...<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Fairly. So are Adam and
Jerome.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> That kind of leaves the heads of the other Family
branches.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Or people in close proximity to
them.<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> (<I>nods</I>) Point.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> We think
there's a mole at LHS. Because somehow they found out about the NASA
trip.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> You're nuts. If they'd been at school, I'd have
spotted them by now.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> She left the surveillance gear up.
Laziness or foresight -- I'm not making that call.<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> Could
just be luck.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Slack... I don't believe in
coincidence.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Someone related to a student,
maybe.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> But not the Landons.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Someone
related to a student... (<I>thinking</I>) I saw "Rust" throw a hard look at his
father. And what Rust told me about the decaf. He said they didn't even keep
decaf in the house!<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> Sounds like evidence, and like a
plan.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> I know it's circumstantial evidence, but it's a lot
of circumstantial evidence a</I>), and b</I>) there's no evidence pointing at
anyone else.<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> Point taken.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> We just kill
him now to save time, then?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> That's not funny,
Lynn!<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> That wasn't meant to be funny. If it was him, look
what he's done!<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> He's graduated from remora to lamprey,
that's what he's done.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> How about to
leech?<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> I'm pretty sure lampreys suck blood too. My dad's an
oceanographer. Not exactly a marine biologist, but he knows
enough.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> WILL YOU TWO SHUT <B>UP</B>?<BR><BR>(<I>Short pause
in which the players collect themselves.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> In any
event. This is why the caution with public information.<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B>
(<I>nods</I>) Sensible.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> So we suspect. And we're not doing
anything about it?<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> If he dies, his backtrail dies with
him.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Innocent until proven? <BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> How much
more proof do you want? A dead body at his feet?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Well,
you remember I said no one is to leave for any reason? Not even to run to a
store or whatever?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Vividly.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> How does
certain sabotage on his car sound?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> What kind of
sabotage?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Dig out the steering wheel airbag, replace it
with a tranq dart, set it to trigger with the ignition.<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B>
(<I>chuckles</I>) Desmond Llewellyn, call your office.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B>
The sound you just heard was that flying so far over my head it had to file a
flight plan.<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> 'Q' from the Bond movies. Before the latter
part of the Brosnan era, anyway.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> I'm sure this isn't the
time or place for mindless trivia-buffery -- or maybe that should be
<B>buffoonery</B>.<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> Is that even a word?
<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> This <B>also</B> isn't the time and place for random
verbal sniping.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Warlock, I'm not sure a dart is what you're
looking for. You have to be careful where you aim it, for one thing. Not to
mention dosage. If you want him alive...<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> Which we do, now
you mention it.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> You're telling them how to do their
job?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Hey, I practically wrote the book.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B>
You <B>did</B> write the book.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Lynn, you just gave me a
better idea. <BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Why does that scare me?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B>
You think the Maverick remembers the formula for that knockout
spray?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> What do you mean remember? He carries a supply of the
stuff since the incident with the gunman. Whether he'd get time to use it is
another thing, but it makes him feel safer. <BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> (<I>nods
again</I>) Wise of him.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Enough to load the airbag
compartment with it?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>thinks</I>) Yes, I think
so.<BR><BR>(<I>At this point, it's Daria that looks scared -- she sees how well
Lynn fits here and it's not good.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> Works for
me.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> The question at that point is, how do we make it work
for <B>him</B>? Or <B>on</B> him?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> That <B>is</B> the
question.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>*sigh*</I>) Let me talk to AP. I'm sure he can
rig it. I mean, if he can set up a blow-up doll in the airbag of Sam Stack's
convertible...<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Peril...<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Look, I have
to be a part of this <B>somehow</B>, don't I? This is personal now. And if all I
can do is arrange the deed done, I'll <B>do</B> it. Just make sure he gets
everything he needs -- including time and cover -- to do what you need him to
do.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Understood.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Nice to know. Now if
you'll excuse me, I have things to do.<BR><BR>(<I>Lynn heads off. Daria glares
at the two men and follows her out.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: corridor. Music plays on. Daria
has to jog to catch up to Lynn, and struggles to keep up as she strides down the
corridor.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Are you okay?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> I
suppose.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> (<I>wry</I>) Of course. <B>Not</B> being okay
would involve you acknowledging the emotional side of
things.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Want to stop posting to alt.pot.kettle.black for
awhile, Daria?<BR><BR>(<I>They walk for a moment in
silence.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Okay. Fine. You want emotion? I'm terrified.
Things weren't great when I first came to Lawndale, but the problems I had were
manageable. Mom put work ahead of her family, Dad was clueless and a half-assed
parent, Quinn was...<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Quinn was Quinn. Carry
on.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> But it had its compensations. I had a best friend, who
made school purgatory as close to fun as it was ever going to get. And then I
had <B>two</B> friends who did that. And then three. Then, before I know what's
happening, one of my friends is my sister, and the bloodline we share goes back
a long way in the crime annals. And now people want my sisters dead, not to
mention my friends, and <B>me</B>. Instead of just watching the Barksdales or
the Morgendorrfers or both warring with words over Christmas, I get to spend it
in fear of my life. And yes, it scares me. And it pisses me off beyond my
ability to express it.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> And it's my
fault.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> (<I>Oh crap</I>) Lynn, I didn't
mean...<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Probably not, but it's true. I wonder if you know
just how bad I feel about this. How I wish I'd never been in any of your lives.
How I would give anything -- anything at all -- to get you out of the firing
line. Or if you'd believe it even if I had the words to say it. (<I>beat</I>)
Now if you'll excuse me, I need to talk to AP about this whole "get Angier"
thing.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Lynn...!<BR><BR>(<I>But Lynn has ducked into an
elevator and hit the 'door close' button, shutting Daria
out.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: parking lot. Dusk, light rain. Remora loads a
car. Pan over to a window, black like the rest, but
inside...</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: hotel room. Tom is looking out the window
with a pair of binoculars.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> (<I>mutter to himself</I>)
Oh, damnit...<BR><BR>(<I>He drops the binos, slaps a clip into his gun, shoves
it into the waistband of his trousers and heads out at a
run.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: Lynn and Jane's hotel room. Jane is sketching on
her still-unmade bed and Lynn is standing at the window. After a moment, Jane
looks up at her. There is a long moment of silence.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B>
Much of a view, out there?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>not looking around</I>)
Parking lot.<BR><BR>(<I>In the beat that follows, cut to what Lynn's looking at
-- the same thing Tom saw from his window. A dark figure, obviously Angier,
loading his car.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> (<I>dubious</I>) Seems ... pretty
interesting.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Eh. I'm all out of
book.<BR><BR>(<I>beat</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Oooookay...<BR><BR>(<I>Jane goes
back to her sketchpad. Lynn just keeps looking out the window. After a moment,
she gets a worried and puzzled look on her face. Then she steps away fast,
letting the curtains fall shut, and reaches under the pillow on her bed. Jane
looks up again.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Where're you going?<BR><BR>(<I>Out of
Jane's line of sight, Lynn is stuffing the gun she retrieved from under her
pillow in her unlaced boot.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> I just realised, if I'm all
out of book, I can just raid the gift shop downstairs. Part-owner priviledge.
I'll be back in a while.<BR><BR>(<I>She heads out of the room, not at a run but
still in a bit of a rush. Jane looks after her with a strange, puzzled
expression. Pan towards the window and then through; we see a dark figure
approaching Angier from the shadows.</I>) <BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: parking lot.
Music: Soundgarden -- "Mailman". The dark figure comes up behind Angier.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> Dad, what do you
think you're doing?<BR><BR>(<I>Angier jumps and spins in the same motion, so
that he's facing his hard-faced son. He gapes like a landed fish for a moment,
trying to collect himself.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Angier:</B> Umm... Warlock sent me on
a mission. Top priority, can't wait.<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> Cut the shit, Da...
(<I>he stops in mid word</I>) Remora. I know what you are.<BR><BR>(<I>Angier's
face suddenly goes cold and hard to match his son's.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Angier:</B>
Do you.<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: security office. Music plays on. Scar and Slack seated at a table,
playing cards. Monitors show parking lot, hotel corridors, shots of the main
casino. A rifle is leaned up against one of the work stations nearby; a pistol
is at Slack's right elbow. Scar has two cards in her hand; Slack has about
five.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Scar:</B> (<I>lays the eight of clubs down; knocks on the
table</I>) Diamonds.<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> (<I>starts picking up cards from the
facedown stack on the table. After three, he smirks and lays down the eight of
spades</I>) Hearts.<BR><BR><B>Scar:</B> Damnit, Slack...<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B>
Remember, I worked the tables for a year before they kicked me
upstairs.<BR><BR><B>Scar:</B> (<I>mutter</I>) Card-counting
scum...<BR><BR>(<I>She starts picking up cards. After she picks up her fourth,
Slack takes a look at the parking lot monitor and
facefaults.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> Our little parasite's out there ... and
he's not alone.<BR><BR><B>Scar:</B> (<I>dropping her cards</I>)
WHAT?<BR><BR><BR>(<I>back to the parking lot. Music plays on.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> How could
you?<BR><BR><B>Angier:</B> Maybe you were happy with being kicked in the teeth
constantly. Made constant fun of. Sneered at. Never good enough for them. I
showed them. I showed them ALL.<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> (<I>oh shit, he's a little
over the edge...</I>) But...<BR><BR><B>Angier:</B> Oh, come on, <B>Missing
H</B>. You know what I'm talking about. They promised me money. Power. Best of
all, respect. The respect I couldn't get with this lot of weak minded cowards
led by that ostrich.<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Snap cut to the interior, a common room. Music plays on.
Pagebert is crashed out on a sofa. Warlock's sitting at a table, reading
something off a laptop screen. Scar barges through the door, Slack following a
moment behind. Both of them have their weapons to
hand.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> In the parlance, Remora's doing a
runner.<BR><BR><B>Scar:</B> But he has company. H is out there with
him.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> 'With'?<BR><BR><B>Scar:</B> Well, he's out there,
anyway. Trying to hold him off, from the look.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> (<I>after
a beat</I>) Without backup? (<I>beat</I>) Idiot.<BR><BR>(<I>He gets up and they
charge out of the room.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Snap cut back to parking
lot.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Angier:</B> You could join me, son! You could! Think of the
glory! We'll get a hero's welcome!<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> Get real. The only thing
we'd get is killed.<BR><BR><B>Angier:</B> But I helped them! They owe
me!<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> You owed me. You owed Uncle Adam. That didn't matter to
you.<BR><BR><B>Angier:</B> Adam owed me! His own brother! And look what it got
me. (<I>the light clicks on</I>) You're stalling. I don't want to someday have
to kill you, son. Come with me. Join me.<BR><BR>(<I>For a second, Tom's tempted
to accept. But he knows, if he does, he will never be able to look himself in
the eye in the mirror again.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> No way in hell, Lord
Vader.<BR><BR><B>Angier:</B> Nice ref. (<I>beat</I>) You've been hanging out
with Warlock too long.<BR><BR>(<I>Tom draws his sidearm. So does Remora. They
lock eyes.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Angier:</B> Rus... no. Tom. Last chance. Join me or
die.<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> NOW who's quotehappy?<BR><BR><B>Angier:</B> Answer
me.<BR><BR><B>Tom:</B> Fuck you.<BR><BR>(<I>They bring up their sidearms. The
weapons speak as one. Tom's head snaps back as the bullet tears through his
throat. Remora drops to a knee as his shoulder is punched
through.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Angier:</B> (<I>in pain</I>) Too bad. I
win.<BR><BR>(<I>Suddenly his chest seems to explode and he drops to the ground.
Revealed charging in behind him are Warlock, Scar, and Slack. The latter two
have rifles; Warlock has his 'sweet little pump-action shotgun' from ToD and a
bow strapped across his back, with a quiver of arrows at his
waist.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Scar:</B> No. You lose.<BR><BR>(<I>Warlock walks over to
Tom, flips him over with a boot, sighs</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Rest in
peace, (<I>he starts to say H, stops</I>) Rust.<BR><BR><B>Scar:</B> We'll never
figure out who he told what.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> (<I>looks at Angier</I>) We
shoulda called him Cain. (<I>taking his jacket off</I>) Slack, help
me.<BR><BR>(<I>Slack hands over his own jacket, not quite sure what's going
on.Warlock rigs a makeshift stretcher and hefts Rust onto
it.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Scar:</B> He's dead.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> He proved himself
at the end. I'm not leaving him out here in the rain.<BR><BR>(<I>With that,
Slack grabs one end of the stretcher and Warlock gets the other. Scar watches
them both as they lift him.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> And that? (<I>indicating
Angier</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Let him rot. <BR><BR>(<I>There is a brief
pause, then Warlock puts own his end of the stretcher down and kicks Angier in
the ribs as hard as he can. Slack raises an eyebrow; Scar stares at him,
dumbfounded. He picks up his end of the stretcher
again.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> (<I>cont'd</I>) We'll figure something in the
morning.<BR><BR>(<I>They start walking towards the entrance to the
Isle.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> Who tells Peril about this?<BR><BR>(<I>Warlock
gets an 'oh-shit' look.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> We'll burn that bridge when
we come to...<BR><BR>(<I>They've reached the hideout door now and it becomes
clear that they have come to that bridge a little sooner than expected -- Lynn,
in nightwear and unlaced boots, is standing at the door with a gun in her hand.
She looks them over, then leans a little to look at the corpse Slack and Warlock
carry. There is silence as they are frozen in tableau for a
moment.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>no emotion</I>)
Remora?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Got what he deserved. <BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B>
Doubtful. You weren't out long enough for that. (<I>beat, glances down at
Tom</I>) We treated him like crap. All of us.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B>
Peril...<BR><BR>(<I>She turns and walks back inside. Warlock, Slack and Scar
share a look, then resume bringing Tom's body inside.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Black
screen. White writing reads "22 December 2000". Fade up
to...</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: Biloxi hideout bar. Music: Pop Will Eat Itself -- "Babylon". Daria, Jane, Lynn and Quinn
are seated at a booth, all looking morose to varying degrees. There are cups of
coffee before each of them -- Quinn's hasn't been touched, but the others are
mostly empty.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> (<I>mild depression</I>) What a WASTE; I
mean, he was ANNOYING, but he was CUTE.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>pissed off and
miserable</I>) Shut UP, Quinn.<BR><BR>(<I>Short pause</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B>
This sucks. This sucks SO badly.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B>
Jane...<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> (<I>interrupting</I>) No. I treated him...
(<I>*sigh*</I>) Never mind.<BR><BR>(<I>She grabs the near-full bottle of wine
and exits, brushing past AP as he enters the room. AP looks after her, seeming a
little worried, then looks at the others, who look more
so.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Where's she going?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Don't
ask.<BR><BR>(<I>There is an uncomfortable pause as AP takes Jane's vacant seat.
He starts toying with her mug thoughtfully.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Well... I
don't even know what to think here. I mean, I didn't... I didn't think any of
us... I didn't think any of us was going to fucking SNUFF it, that's
all!<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B>
AP...<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Yeah, well, I KNOW, but if he can... I
mean...<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> AP, if you would calm down for just one second...
<BR><BR>(<I>AP drops the mug. It bounces off the table, hits the floor and
shatters. AP takes a deep breath and appears to calm down</I>)
<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>cont'd</I>) Tom wasn't built for this; he was being
raised for something ... different. Why he was thrown into this, I don't
know.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> (<I>bitterness</I>) Probably because Family doesn't
give a damn about Family...<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>cutting her off</I>) No,
ANGIER didn't give a damn about Family.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> (<I>backtrack</I>)
Lynn...<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>'not discussing this' tone</I>) NO.
(<I>beat</I>) No.<BR><BR>(<I>More uncomfortable silence</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B>
(<I>Sledgehammer of Subject Change</I>) Art-Smart Scarlet's taking it
hard.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Yeah, I know. She didn't exactly ... well, after how
their relationship ended...<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Should it have mattered,
REALLY?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Quinn...<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Well, I mean, if she
LIKED him...<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>pointed</I>) You liked Ted, didn't
you?<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> (<I>miserable; angry</I>) Don't talk about that.
That's not FAIR.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Yes it is.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Well,
actually, no it isn't.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> AP?<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Well, it
ISN'T! I mean... Well... (<I>*sigh*</I>) AwhellIdontknowwhatImean. I guess this
Family crap just screws with everything, doesn't it.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B>
(<I>quiet, nearly hopeful</I>) It doesn't have to.<BR><BR>(<I>Very short pause;
Sledgehammer of Subject change swung by...</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> That
reminds me; do we have any news on Kes and DJ?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> No; no we
don't. Kes is still in surgery ... as far as I know, anyway. Warlock's playing
things closer to the vest than I'd like.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> (<I>responding to
the bitterness</I>) Lynn...<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> No, it's my FAMILY. With a small
f.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Mine too. Technically.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Yeah, but you
haven't known them very long, have you?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Maybe it shouldn't
matter so much at this point.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>conceding</I>)
Maybe.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> (<I>exasperated sigh</I>) Daria ... why are you
talking about them like they ARE your family?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B>
(<I>incredulous anger</I>) ExCUSE me?<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> (<I>to Daria,
ignoring Lynn</I>) Well, you don't know them, you're only half-related to them
and ... (<I>utter frustration</I>) ...they're going to get you KILLED,
Daria!<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> (<I>concern</I>) Quinn?<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B>
(<I>near tears</I>) No; I CAN'T! I ... just CAN'T!<BR><BR>(<I>She gets up too
quickly, nearly knocking her chair over, and runs out with her hands over her
face. There is silence.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Well. That's an interesting
turn of events.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Now. Here's the question: which one of them
do I talk to?<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Come again?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Do I talk to
Jane, who obviously needs someone right about now ... or do I talk to Quinn, my
up-until-recently-thought whole sister?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> That's your call,
Daria. I mean, I could try to talk to Jane, but I don't think I would do as much
good as you would and ... well, I don't really think Quinn wants to deal with ME
right about now.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> You make a point. (<I>beat; deep sigh</I>)
You may as well just rename them Scylla and Charybdis and be done with it.
(<I>AP snickers, to Daria's obvious confusion</I>) AP?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B>
(<I>head in hands</I>) Just ... don't ... ask, Daria. If you have any respect
for me at ALL, you will NOT ask.<BR><BR>(<I>Short pause while AP gets himself
under control.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> So what're you gonna do?<BR><BR>(<I>Daria
just gives a miserable shrug.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: Daria and Quinn's room. Music: Therapy? -- "Unbeliever". Quinn is flopped face-down on her bed, not even crying. The door opens and Daria
stands there for a moment. Then she knocks on the doorframe and waits for
acknowledgement. She doesn't get it. After a moment, she steps into the room and
sits down on her own pristine bed. She takes a deep breath to collect
herself.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> It's going to be okay,
Quinn.<BR><BR>(<I>Quinn raises her face from the pillow and glares at
Daria.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Yeah, <B>right</B>, Daria! You're always so
<B>good</B> at telling it like it <B>is</B>, and now you tell me that all
<B>this</B> is going to be okay when people are <B>dying</B> all over the place!
I'm not so stupid that you can lie to me and keep me from feeling bad cos I feel
bad enough <B>already</B>, okay?<BR><BR>(<I>Quinn buries her face back in the
pillow. Daria looks at her for a moment.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Okay, let me
amend the statement. If we sit back and let it keep getting worse, it
<B>isn't</B> going to be okay.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> (<I>looking up again</I>)
Like <B>we</B> can do anything about it! We're just
<B>kids</B>!<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> That's true. But we're <B>smart</B> kids. With
talents. And if we use the brains and the talents we have, we stand a better
chance at getting out of this alive than if we stick our heads in the sand.
(<I>beat</I>) Or the synthetic fabric of a pillowcase.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Oh,
go <B>away</B>, Daria! Go and hang out with your <B>friends</B>, or something.
(<I>beat</I>) Or your <B>real</B> sister.<BR><BR>(<I>Daria looks almost
shocked.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Quinn, <B>you're</B> my sister as much as she
is. In ways, more.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> You stand <B>up</B> for her! You went
out of your way to rescue her!<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> I would have done the same
for <B>you</B>, if Lynn hadn't done it first.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> You'd
<B>rather</B> have grown up with <B>her</B>. You <B>like</B> her
better!<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Familiarity breeds contempt.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B>
What's <B>that</B> supposed to mean?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> I've grown up with
you. I've seen you twenty-four hours a day, three hundred and sixty-five days a
year, for most of my life. I've listened to you belittle me in front of your
friends, get the lion's share of our parents' attention, and waste your brain in
the never-ending search for popularity. I know you well enough to know when
you're being manipulative, wasteful and just plain stupid -- and I see it all
the time. You get to know someone well enough, sometimes you outwardly get sick
of them.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> I ... I ... you think that's why I always try to
be so <B>different</B> from you? Cos I get sick of you?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B>
That's probably part of it. It's also something you can be better at than me,
mostly because I don't have the least bit of interest in it.<BR><BR>(<I>There's
a long pause.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> I don't want to die. And I don't want
<B>you</B> to die either.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> I second that. But the situation
is as the situation is. And burying your head in a pillow and hoping it will all
just go away won't make it do that. (<I>beat</I>) If you don't at least try to
get along with the rest of us, at least for a little while, it's going to get
harder to keep you safe. Ever heard of a tactic called "divide and
conquer"?<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Like Sandi always tried to do with Stacy and
Tiffany and me to make sure we'd never gang up on her and kick her <B>out</B>?
(<I>Daria raises an eyebrow</I>) Once I got out of the Fashion Club, I kinda
picked up on that.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Okay. In that case, yes. So will you try
not to irritate people so they'll be more willing to keep you
alive?<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Uh ... sure! I mean, I'm <B>good</B> at fitting
in!<BR><BR>(<I>Daria rolls her eyes in an affectionate
manner.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> I guess you are.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B>
<B>Now</B> are you going to go and talk to your Jane friend? (<I>to Daria's
surprised look</I>) I picked up on that <B>too</B>; I mean, <B>duh</B>! But
why'd you come see me <B>first</B>?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Don't make me say it.
I've said enough to prove the sisterly bond.<BR><BR>(<I>She walks out of the
room. Quinn looks after her with a thoughtful expression, then gives a little
smile.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: Jane and Lynn's room. Music: Offspring -- "Denial, Revisited". Jane has a pad on her
knee and a stick of charcoal with her hand, furiously sketching. Daria hovers in
the doorway. She clears her throat, and Jane looks up. Without a word, she holds
up the pad. It depicts a rainy-day graveyard scene where pale shadows -- mist or
ghosts, we can't be sure at this distance -- hover. Daria steps
closer.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> It's...<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Dark? Depressing?
Morbid?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> ...Actually, I was going to say it's just what this
room needs. Art with personality.<BR><BR>(<I>She nods a little at the bland
landscape hanging on one of the walls. Jane gives a reluctant
smile.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> The Horror-Show Hotel. Hey, think that Slack guy
could turn a profit on that concept?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Well, I'd say it would
clash with the architecture, but I'm pretty sure you'd say that the design of
this building is enough of a horror-show for anyone.<BR><BR>(<I>Jane gives
another reluctant smile.</I>) <BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> You
okay?<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Hell no.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Do you want to talk
about it?<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Hell no.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Do you just want me
to sit here and not pressure you to talk so that you can be alone but not
alone?<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Hell yes.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Got a
book?<BR><BR>(<I>Jane gestures towards Lynn's side of the room. Daria moves
across towards the windows, where Lynn's bag is lying. She rummages, pulls out
Clive Barker's "Weaveworld", then looks back. Instead of sitting on the side of
Lynn's bed nearest the window, she moves around to the gap between the two beds
and sits down on Lynn's bed, but fairly near to Jane. She opens the book without
another word. Jane looks up and gives a grateful half-smile before going back to
her sketch. Companionable silence follows.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: a generic
hospital room. Music: Will Haven -- "If She Could Speak". Privacy curtain is
drawn between the two beds. In one is DJ, sitting up and reading. In the other
is Kes. She's intubated and attached to two IVs -- one saline, the other whole
blood. She blinks a couple times, panic clear in her eyes. She pulls at the tape
binding both her arms to the bedframe [for the convenience of the
IV's].</I>)<BR><BR><B>DJ:</B> Kes? You awake?<BR><BR>(<I>Kes freezes. She has
absolutely no idea who the voice belongs to.</I>)<BR><BR><B>DJ:</B> It's okay.
Aph and them pulled us out. Speaking of whom...<BR><BR>(<I>Kes is still tense.
She knows the voice, but can't attach it to a name -- or even to an affiliation.
Until...</I>)<BR><BR><B>DJ:</B> (<I>dials phone, pauses</I>) NCM? DJ. She's
awake.<BR><BR>(<I>Kes relaxes.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: Warlock's room. Music
plays on. Warlock is on his bed, grabbing some much-needed sleep. There is a
muted ringing from across the room. It stops without Warlock waking; muted
mumbling is heard in the background. Then a hand pokes Warlock in the back. He's
immediately awake and turns to see Daria standing over
him.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Meef...?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> We've been
watching you for an hour and a half now. (<I>beat; dry</I>) We had orders from
on high.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Why?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Fielding internal
questions and standing guard so you could get some sleep. We didn't want to, but
it was pointed out to us that you're the best chance we have of getting out of
this alive. But I had to wake you for this.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> For
what?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> It was your phone. Kes is awake. And talking. Sort
of.<BR><BR>(<I>For a moment, Warlock just sits and stares at Daria, who stands
impassive.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> "Sort of".<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B>
Apparently, they're keeping her intubated for a little while longer until
they're a bit more secure about her lungs. Though NCM said something about "it
being almost worth it to shut her up for awhile". And given what she helped make
me do in Pittsburgh, I can't really disagree with him.<BR><BR>(<I>Warlock looks
at her in shock. Daria gives a <B>very</B> thin version of her Mona Lisa
smile.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> In any other circumstances, I might say the
same. Not here, though. But thanks for the attempt at
humour.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Just don't let it get around; I have a reputation
to maintain. (<I>beat</I>) Anyway, he said they were going to get information
out of her and to give them a half-hour or so to do it. Consensus is she's
fairly resourceful.<BR><BR>(<I>Warlock nods and looks at her. The expression on
his face isn't exactly expectant, but Daria knows.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B>
(<I>cont'd</I>) DJ's fine. She was the one who made the call telling them she
was awake. Best not to call at the hospital, though.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Why
not? She not taking calls?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Not because of DJ's inability to
take phone conversations. Let's just say Kes proved that she and Lynn are
related.<BR><BR>(<I>beat</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Property
damage?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> No, but she nearly ripped the side-rails off the
bed when she found her arms were taped there. Then she started making some very
odd hand gestures.<BR><BR>(<I>Warlock raises an eyebrow at
her.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> DJ thought she was trying to communicate. And
that she might know what happened to ... (<I>gropes for the right thing to call
him</I>) the Falcon.<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: Hospital corridor. Leopard, Aph, NCM
and Chopper pile out of the room and stop in the
hallway.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Leopard:</B> Who calls Warlock with
this?<BR><BR><B>Aph:</B> What about DJ? He'd want to know she's all right
anyway.<BR><BR><B>N.C.M.:</B> Thought about that, but no dice. Nurse Ratchet and
her band of Nazi candy stripers took her cellphone and she'd kill us if we went
in there again. (<I>beat</I>) Lep?<BR><BR><B>Leopard:</B> No WAY; you're not
sticking ME with shit detail just 'cos I'm the youngest!<BR><BR><B>Aph:</B>
(<I>rolling her eyes</I>) <B>I'll</B> do it.<BR><BR><B>N.C.M.:</B> No,
<B>I'll</B> do it. He needs info, not a dramatic reading.<BR><BR><B>Aph:</B>
(<I>scowl</I>) HEY!<BR><BR>(NCM takes out his cellphone ... but stops when
Chopper's phone rings. They all look at Chopper, who shrugs at them and takes
out his phone.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Chopper:</B> Yeah? (<I>beat</I>) We were about to
call you. Got news on the snake in the grass. It's...<BR><BR>(<I>Split-screen on
Warlock, who's just a bit too tired to hide anger and
sadness.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Remora, I know. He's dead. Anything
else?<BR><BR><B>Chopper:</B> (<I>blink</I>) Uh... Falcon's dead. They got him
and he did the cyanide pill thing.<BR><BR>(<I>Beat</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B>
Good. I'll be in touch. <BR><BR>(<I>As Warlock's phone clicks off, back to
single screen and a bemused and annoyed Chopper.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Chopper:</B> Not
the most polite person, him.<BR><BR><B>Leopard:</B> Pity the man,
Chopper.<BR><BR><B>Chopper:</B> Why the hell should I?<BR><BR><B>Leopard:</B>
He's gonna have to tell the Peril her father's dead.<BR><BR>(<I>Total,
thoughtful silence. Chopper looks almost ashamed of
himself.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Black screen. White writing reads "23 December,
2000". Fade up to...</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: basement loading dock and
storage area. Music: Demons and Wizards -- "Blood on my Hands". There are crates everywhere, but there's a cleared space; Trent,
Jesse and Nick are tuning their guitars. Max is setting up his drumkit. Daria,
Jane and AP are sitting on crates, watching them set up.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B>
You couldn't have left <B>without</B> that stuff?<BR><BR><B>Trent:</B> Says the
punk who's got a chemistry set all over the room.<BR><BR><B>Jesse:</B> We wanted
to play. Stay sharp.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Jesse. Sharp. That's about as much an
oxymoron as Microsoft Works.<BR><BR><B>Nick:</B> Where's Lynn, anyway? She had
that ripping set of lyrics and Trent thinks he has a tune, don't you,
man?<BR><BR><B>Trent:</B> Yeah, but give her some time, Nick. Dunno what Warlock
wanted her for.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Probably bawling her out for the mall trip
again.<BR><BR><B>Max:</B> I still don't believe you didn't let us in on that!
You think we didn't want out too?<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> (<I>dry</I>) Yeah, but
you're such a criminale, we figured you'd make more trouble than it was
worth.<BR><BR><B>Max:</B> (<I>proud</I>) Really? Cool!<BR><BR>(<I>Door opens.
Lynn steps in. She looks horrible. No one's sure entirely what to
say.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> I came to say that I'm not singing. That is
all.<BR><BR>(<I>She turns around and heads back towards the
door.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Hey, Purple Peril, hold up! What's going
on?<BR><BR>(<I>Lynn stops but she doesn't turn around.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B>
Daria.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> (<I>trepidatious</I>) Yeah?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Our
father's dead.<BR><BR>(<I>Shocked silence. Lynn starts walking again. Jane, the
fastest of them, gets up and sprints for the door, slamming it shut almost on
Lynn's nose.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> In the immortal words of <B>both</B> of
you ... ex<B>cuse</B> me?<BR><BR><B>Trent:</B> Lynn?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> So ...
it's confirmed, then?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>still facing the door, not looking
at anyone</I>) The story is that he and Adam were cornered on their way to a
rendezvous with Leopard. They couldn't fight their way free, so the theory is
that Adam was a mercy-killing, to prevent him from being tortured for
information. (<I>beat</I>) As for Dad ... he was prevented from doing the same
job on himself, but managed to pop a cyanide pill before he spilled
anything.<BR><BR>(<I>A long moment of tense, shocked silence. Lynn is still
refusing to face her friends.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> I'm not sure if I think
that's sick or noble.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Maybe there's not too much difference
between the two concepts, with a Mafia family.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Now if you'll
excuse me...<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> You're not going to do anything stupid, are
you?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> You keep asking me that. (<I>beat</I>) In this case,
the answer is "not yet".<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Lynn, I
know...<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Forgive me for pointing out that you know
<B>nothing</B> about this, Daria. This was the ultimate act of war; the Smythes
either fight or roll over and die. And I don't think <B>anyone</B> in this
organisation knows how to do that.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Which means they're
going to anything they can to keep you ... us ... out of the firing
line.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> <B>Us</B>, maybe... But I'd like to make sure I know
who they <B>are</B> sending to retaliate.<BR><BR>(<I>There's an exchange of
looks; Trent, Jesse, Nick and Max look unaccountably nervous. Exit Lynn with
Jane on her heels. Daria and AP follow.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jesse:</B> They'll find
out.<BR><BR><B>Trent:</B> I know, man. I know.<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: same, some
time later. Music: Alice in Chains -- "We Die Young". Trent, Jesse, Nick and Max have abandoned their instruments and are
going through the boxes. Trent has a couple of pistols; shrugs and sticks them
in his belt. Jesse is tying his hair back; he's wearing a black T-shirt under
the black leather vest, a machete hangs at his belt and, with his arms raised,
we see the Colt .45 in the shoulder holster he wears. Nick and Max pull out
wicked-looking machine guns with near-identical grins of
satisfaction.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> (<I>OS</I>) Put them
down.<BR><BR><B>Max:</B> Aw, come on, man, we're criminales! Big-ass guns are
what criminales are all <B>about</B>!<BR><BR>(<I>Warlock comes into shot with
the sternest look imaginable on his face.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Handguns
only.<BR><BR>(<I>Nick and Max, sullen but cowed, put the nasty guns down and
accept the 9mm pistols Warlock offers. Enter Daria and Jane like avenging
angels, with Lynn and AP close behind.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B>
NO!<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> No, <B>what</B>?<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Only one part of
the owner's codename fits him. Since he doesn't wear a monkey
suit...<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> (<I>down to essentials</I>) He still hasn't swept for
bugs yet. They know. 'Bout New Orleans.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Most of our
operatives are in the North, or gone to the mattresses. Word is that a Merritt
base in New Orleans has the information we need to take this fight to the
Merritts. It's a simple in-and-out...<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Not the band. Not any
of them. Do you understand me? This isn't their fight!<BR><BR><B>Trent:</B> Sure
it is, Lynn. <BR><BR>(<I>Lynn turns on him, but Jane beats her to
it.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> How the <B>hell</B> is this your fight? You
shouldn't even be involved!<BR><BR><B>Trent:</B> If we don't fight them now ...
fight 'em and win ... they're gonna get you, Janey. And Lynn. And Daria.
(<I>beat; that last hit hard</I>) Even the punk. And they won't let you fight,
even though from what I hear, you'd be best at it. So we're gonna. We protect
what's ours. Like Max says -- we're criminales. For real ... for
now.<BR><BR>(<I>Daria looks at him for a long moment. Lynn watches them both.
After a moment, Daria steps up to him slowly and kisses him on the lips;
closed-mouthed but nothing even approaching chaste. Lynn smiles. After a long
moment, Daria pulls away. Trent looks completely stunned, lost in his own little
world.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Chivalry isn't dead, is it? It's just a little
stupid. (<I>beat; to the rest of the band</I>) You'll watch his
back?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Daria, you're not accepting
this...?<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> <B>I'm</B> sure as hell not!<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B>
Scar'll be with them. She'll cover their backs.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Yeah, but
will she be <B>enough</B>? This is my brother's <B>life</B> you're gambling
with!<BR><BR><B>Jesse:</B> Her? Maybe. Her <B>and</B> us?
Sure.<BR><BR><B>Nick:</B> Hey, we look after our own, Jane! You know
that!<BR><BR><B>Max:</B> Yeah, man! We're...<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> I know, I know,
criminales. (<I>beat</I>) Can I...?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Don't even say it!
(<I>beat</I>) It's bad enough if <B>they're</B> determined to
go.<BR><BR>(<I>Trent is still standing there, totally
lost.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jesse:</B> It'll be cool, Lynn. Daria. Jane. We'll keep
safe.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Just make sure you do. I guess that's all I can
say.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> I can say one more thing. (<I>beat; right in Trent's
face</I>) You don't come back, and that kiss you just got from her will only
happen to you once.<BR><BR>(<I>They leave; AP looks at Lynn, who nods towards
the door. He follows the others out. Lynn watches Trent, who's still standing
there with that dazed, vaguely happy look.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Trent:</B>
(<I>near-whisper</I>) Once was plenty...<BR><BR>(<I>Lynn steps up to him, a
bland look on her face.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> I once said to her that if she
hurt AP, I would make her life hell. (<I>beat</I>) Come back alive. For her. Or
I'll kick your ass via astral projection if necessary.<BR><BR><B>Trent:</B> I
didn't think you believe in that stuff, Lynn.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> We're all
grasping at straws here, Trent. (<I>beat</I>) Besides, I think you'd make a damn
good brother-in-law.<BR><BR>(<I>She leaves. Jesse, Nick and Max cluster around
him.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jesse:</B> You cool?<BR><BR><B>Trent:</B> Oh
yeah.<BR><BR><B>Max:</B> Sure you wanna do this, man? You got a lot to
lose.<BR><BR><B>Trent:</B> No more than Nick does. Less, really. (<I>beat</I>)
Hey, man, <B>you</B> want out?<BR><BR>(<I>Nick
hesitates.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Nick:</B> We're the Spiral, man. The original. You go,
I go.<BR><BR><B>Max:</B> Criminales all the way, guys! Right?<BR><BR>(<I>A short
silence, in which there is solidarity, but fear.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Trent:</B> We're
a freaky bunch of friends, man.<BR><BR><B>Jesse:</B> Freakin'
friends.<BR><BR><B>Trent:</B> Hey, someone else wanna drive first? That'd make a
cool song.<BR><BR>(<I>All bearing weapons, they pile out of
shot.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: security office. Music: Smashing Pumpkins -- "Fuck You [an Ode to No One] There's a chessboard set up on
the table. Warlock's sitting, watching the security camera views, when Lynn
walks in.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Why them? Why them and not
me?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> You know.<BR><BR>(<I>He turns around to face the
table, now directly in front of the black pieces. Lynn drags a chair around and
sits in front of the white pieces.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> They're not as well
trained as I am. (<I>beat</I>) This had better not be one of those ageist,
sexist things.<BR><BR>(<I>She moves one of the white pawns ahead two spaces --
by some unspoken agreement, a game has begun.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B>
They're also expendable.<BR><BR>(<I>He moves a pawn of his
own.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Not to <B>us</B>, they're
not.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> You're the Family's best chance at long-term
survival.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Others could take the position. They may have to
anyway, if I decide I don't want to play.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Others would
also be resented.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> And I won't be? Warlock, I'm
<B>eighteen</B>!<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> You're also the natural successor, in
more ways than one.<BR><BR>(<I>There's a pause, as Lynn looks at the chessboard,
considering her next move. She picks up a knight, toys with
it.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> This is personal now. It <B>has</B> to be my
fight.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Personal isn't the same as important,
Peril.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Oh, spare me the Terry Pratchett bullshit. They are
going after my immediate circle. (<I>beat</I>) They got my father killed. They
got Tom killed. Kes is in the hospital. And how many times have they tried to
kill Daria? And the others?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> You've seen what taking on
too much has done to your family.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> That's the point -- it's
my family; so my fight.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> And what do you think it would do
to the Maverick, if you got lost out there? (<I>moves a piece</I>)
Check.<BR><BR>(<I>beat</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> You miserable overprotective
wanker.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Your little stunt in San Francisco made that part
of my job description.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Well, it's sort of part of <B>my</B>
job description to be protective of the band. They need <B>some</B>
guidance...<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> They've got Scar.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Scar
doesn't know how to handle them. I <B>do</B>. (<I>moves a piece</I>)
Check.<BR><BR>(<I>Beat as Warlock calmly studies the
board.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> And if you go out on some unprofessional
kamikaze run and get killed yourself, <B>she</B> becomes the natural
successor.<BR><BR>(<I>Beat; Warlock considers, moves a bishop. Lynn frowns at
the board.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> I'm better than that, and you <B>know</B>
it.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> You're telling me that you're willing to throw away
your family, your friends and someone you love for a revenge ride? (<I>moves a
piece</I>) Checkmate.<BR><BR>(<I>She studies the board, then tips her king over.
She walks out without a word.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Black screen. White writing

estate, somewhere outside New Orleans. Music: Duran Duran -- "A View to a Kill". Zoom in on a large unmarked van parked
off to the side of the administrative building.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene:
inside the van. Music plays on. Five black-clad people are in the back, poring over a plan of
the compound. Four of them are obviously turning to the fifth -- a tall man with
short mouse-brown hair slicked back from his face -- as their leader; shooting
odd glances at him from time to time. He looks only at the map. A large,
heavyset man of Samoan descent sits behind the wheel of the van; headphones with
an attached mike are on his head. After a moment, he turns towards his
passengers.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Samoan:</B> Time-check, people. We havin' company in
fifteen. So fill them in on the plan, Kat.<BR><BR>(<I>The tall leader-man raises
an eyebrow, but says nothing about the informality. Instead, he addresses his
strike team.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Kat:</B> We are to allow them access to the compound
-- they will get the information they require, and they will leave. By the time
they have left the building, we will have the entire area covered.<BR><BR>(<I>A
young woman with long curly hair tied in a braid with a red ribbon looks
scornfully at him. When she speaks, it is with a very strong French
accent.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Frenchy:</B> How is it you are here now, if this is so?
We do this well enough without ... without les assassins

happened.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Kat:</B> Your job is to kill as many of these people as
you can. My job is to take out the primary target.<BR><BR><B>Blond:</B> And who
the hell <B>is</B> the primary target? Or don't we get to find that out

the Smythe Affiliation, trusted advisor to the acting head of their family.
Strengths include her hand-to-hand expertise, an encyclopaedic knowledge of
firearms and the hand-eye coodination to make the best possible use of that
knowledge, and a certain amount of bravery. Weakness is her temper -- she has a
slight tendency towards arrogance that gives a window of vulnerability lasting
anywhere between thirty and seventy-five seconds. I was put among you to make
best use of that window. So I repeat -- your job is to kill as many of her
companions as you can. You kill any innocents, I kill you. You kill my kill, you
get my pay. And that will make me unhappy.<BR><BR>(<I>He says this with no
inflection whatsoever but everyone in his team flinches back from him ... except
Dom, who looks at him with a glint of speculation in her
eye.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: Sitting room, Biloxi hideout, late evening. Music: Duncan Sheik -- "Home".
There is a very small Christmas tree in one corner. Lynn's curled up on the
sofa, in nightwear, gun close to hand, reading. She hears footsteps and her hand
drops on the gun even though it's clear from her expression she knows who it is.
AP appears in the doorway in track suit bottoms and a Dexter's Lab T-Shirt
["This Looks Like A Fine Day For SCIENCE!"], rubbing his eyes like a sleepy
5-year-old.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> You're not on watch

Thought I'd keep ya comp'ny.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>sweet little smile; closes
book</I>) Always glad of it.<BR><BR>(<I>AP plops down on the sofa next to her.
Silence for a moment.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Purple Peril?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B>
Yeah?<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Uh ... Y'know Warlock keeps saying that you kinda sorta
should stay out of the fight? (<I>in a rush</I>)
WellIagreewithhim.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>turning on him</I>) Excuse
me?<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> (<I>grabbing her by the shoulders, giving her a shake</I>)
Look, Lynn! You don't GET it! People ... have it ... IN for you! And ...
(<I>turning his face away from her</I>) well ... you've come too close. I can't
take that. (<I>looking at her again</I>) So listen to the man. For
me?<BR><BR>(<I>long pause</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> You know how low that
is?<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Any weapon I can get my hands on, Purple

won't press the issue. (<I>beat</I>) I can't promise that I'll be able to keep
to that if we lose anyone else to this crap.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> I ...
(<I>*sigh*</I>) just don't want to lose you.<BR><BR>(<I>Lynn decides not to
answer that verbally -- she just snuggles up next to him. AP puts an arm around
her and they sit in a companionable but uneasy silence. Then AP gets an idea --
visible *ping*</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Hey, Purple Peril? Remember when I was
eight and you'd just turned nine and we snuck out on Christmas Eve and exchanged
presents under that big pine tree in Redgrave Park?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B>
Yeaaaaaaah...<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> We-ell... (<I>hopeful look; pulls a little
wrapped box out of his pocket</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>smile</I>) Okay,
fine. You'll probably appreciate not having to unwrap mine with everyone
watching anyway.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> (<I>blink</I>) Come again?<BR><BR>(<I>Lynn
gets up and rummages through her bag, coming up with a wrapped parcel, which she
hands to AP. Then she sits next to him and watches him as he looks at
it.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> This is one for tonight. You get the other
Christmas morning.<BR><BR>(<I>He looks at her, then at the parcel, then opens it
up. Inside is a navy blue T-shirt -- yellow cursive writing across the front
reads "Code Poet". He looks at it for a long moment, Lynn watching him with some
trepidation. Then he looks at her and, lacking the words as usual, just grabs
her in a hug. She isn't braced, so she flops on her back. Pan to the doorway,
where Warlock and Daria, probably heading towards their own turn on watch, are
standing.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> (<I>aside to Daria</I>) Anyone tries to
get to them, they'd have to get through me first.<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Black screen.

knock and it opens without permission a split-second later. Warlock barges in,
looking harrassed.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Okay, Slack, if we're going to do
this, we have to do it now. Get...<BR><BR>(<I>He freezes in the doorway. Cut to
what he's seeing -- a pale, worried-looking Slack sitting at his desk,
accompanied by a heavyset goateed blond guy in a Buffalo Sabres cap ... and

Fett?<BR><BR><B>Fett:</B> Incubus showed up on our doorstep couple days ago.
Wisconsin got hit and they needed a hole.<BR><BR><B>Jodie:</B> (<I>little scared
voice</I>) They shot Mr Hopper. A lot.<BR><BR><B>Mack:</B> I thought we were
supposed to be dragged out of Lawndale to get <B>out</B> of this kind of
trouble!<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> So where <B>are</B> the Sloanes? And
Incubus?<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> I sent them out to Pagebert and Scar. Figured
someone ought to tell them about Remora and Rust.<BR><BR><B>Jodie:</B> ... Wait.
What <B>about</B> them? Did something happen to Tom and Angier?<BR><BR>(<I>There
is silence. Jodie gets visibly tenser.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jodie:</B> Answer me. Did
something happen to them? (<I>beat</I>) But they weren't ... if someone wants
them, does this mean they could go after Dad? (<I>beat</I>) WHAT IS GOING
<B>ON</B>?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Talk to the Peril. I haven't got time for
this.<BR><BR><B>Mack:</B> Don't talk to her like that!<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B>
Shut up. That kind of thing is something <B>else</B> I haven't got time
for.<BR><BR><B>Fett:</B> Chill the hell <B>out</B>, Herr Warlock! They're just
<B>kids</B>!<BR><BR>(<I>The two men glare at each other for a moment. Slack
holds up his hands, trying to get everyone's
attention.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> (<I>to Jodie and Mack</I>) Try room 316.
Scarlet and the Peril should be in there.<BR><BR>(<I>Jodie and Mack nod at
Slack, shoot Warlock glares of their own, and exit.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene:
the room. Music plays on. Jane's sketching. Lynn's pacing like something caged. Jane looks up at
her occasionally, looking more and more stressed every
time.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Stoppit, you. I can't <B>draw</B> when you're
like this.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> I can't help it. They disarmed me, they've got me
on surveillance, and <B>why</B>?<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Cos they're afraid you're
gonna go psycho, maybe?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> And can you <B>blame</B>
me?<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Look, it's worse for me than it is for you, Lynn, and
you <B>know</B> it.<BR><BR>(<I>That freezes Lynn in her tracks and she sits on
the floor, looking at her boots. There's a knock on the door. Lynn reaches out,
grabs a book and throws it at the door as hard as she
can.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jodie:</B> (<I>OS</I>) Lynn? Jane? Uh ... merry
Christmas?<BR><BR>(<I>They both look at the door, then at each other -- Jane's
face holds some happy surprise, while Lynn's holds deep
anxiety.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Jodie! Come in!<BR><BR>(<I>The door opens and
Jodie and Mack step in.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> (<I>cont'd</I>) God, it's good
to see familiar faces! (<I>beat; as she really sees those faces</I>) What
happened? Where'd they send you?<BR><BR><B>Jodie:</B> Wisconsin. Green
Bay.<BR><BR><B>Mack:</B> Remind me <B>not</B> to let the Packers pick me in the
draft, if I ever get that far...<BR><BR><B>Jodie:</B> We got there okay, but
when we did, it was a mess. We got to this sports bar and the next thing we know
people are shooting at us. (<I>beat</I>) They got Mr Hopper.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B>
I'm just glad they didn't get <B>you</B>.<BR><BR><B>Jodie:</B> So what's been
going on here? No one was really willing to talk to us downstairs and that
Chinese guy seems <B>really</B> stressed out.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Not surprised.
Assassination attempts on the heirs to his crime empire are going to do
that.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Well, that and his girlfriend and my cousin going
missing. And the hefty attack on the Blue Motorcycle. And...<BR><BR><B>Mack:</B>
They went after <B>Lynn</B>?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> They got us both to Biers via
an ... inside informant ... and torched the place over our
heads.<BR><BR><B>Jodie:</B> It didn't have anything to do with Tom, did it? That
guy Warlock told us to ask you...<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> It's a long story, but
yeah, the inside informant has something to do with Tom.<BR><BR><B>Jodie:</B>
Tom wasn't...<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> No.<BR><BR>(<I>Jane and Lynn won't look at
each other. Jodie and Mack exchange looks</I>) <BR><BR><B>Mack:</B> Then
what?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> There was a confrontation -- Tom and ... him.
(<I>beat</I>) Tom's dead. Along with a whole bunch of other good
people.<BR><BR>(<I>Surprisingly, it's Mack who seems to
understand.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Mack:</B> You're not telling
me...<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Don't say it. He's dead too, so does it bear
considering, what this business will make people do?<BR><BR>(<I>There is
silence. Then a thought hits Jodie.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jodie:</B> You said "heirs",
plural. What about Daria?<BR><BR>(<I>Lynn stands, shoots Jane a look, and walks
out. Jodie and Mack look at each other, panicked.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Mack:</B>
Answer the question, Jane. What happened to Daria?<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Don't
panic; she's okay. Lynn's still a little shaky from the whole thing. She had to
do CPR to bring Daria back. (<I>beat</I>) We're gonna beat the guilt out of her
with a stick eventually.<BR><BR><B>Jodie:</B> Shouldn't she feel <B>better</B>?
She saved Daria's <B>life</B>!<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> But she got Daria's life in
danger in the first place. Or that's how she likes looking at
it.<BR><BR>(<I>Silence. Jodie and Mack look at each other, then watch Jane
cautiously.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Mack:</B> Tell us everything.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B>
Guys, I really don't think you want to be involved in
this...<BR><BR><B>Jodie:</B> We <B>are</B> involved, Jane. If I wasn't involved
the day before Ms Li tried to kill you guys, I got involved the day I
accidentally told Daria about it. And the less we know, the less we can do to
protect ourselves. So tell us.<BR><BR>(<I>Jane looks at them -- their faces are
set and determined. Then she sighs.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> I'll tell you what
I know. But it's not that much and you're not going to like it. Still, it'll
pass the time while we wait for...<BR><BR>(<I>Jane stops herself. Jodie and Mack
glare at her.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jodie:</B> Wait for <B>who</B>?<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B>
(<I>defeated</I>) My brother. My brother and most of his band went out there and
God only <B>knows</B> what's happening to them now...<BR><BR>(<I>Jodie and Mack
look at each other again, worried this time.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: the
industrial estate. Nick is in the back of BWV, with Max slumped on the floor at
his feet; Max is clutching his shoulder and moaning. Trent is standing at the
back doors, a gun in his hand, trying to lay down cover fire for Jesse, who is
carrying a limp, black-clad figure. Another couple of shots ring out and Jesse
slumps to the ground; somehow he manages to toss the dark-clad figure into the
back before he hits the floor. Nick grabs one of Jesse's arms and Trent grabs
the other, and they both haul him into the van. Nick shuts the door behind them
and Trent runs towards the driver's side. He climbs in and BWV starts up. Cut to
the other van, where the Samoan man is still behind the wheel. He speaks into a
walkie-talkie.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Samoan:</B> They're mobile! Are they
<B>supposed</B> to be mobile?<BR><BR><B>Kat:</B> (<I>through walkie</I>) All
units to the van. We have a report to discuss.<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: AP's and
Trent's room. It's a complete pigsty -- clothes, an acoustic guitar, AP's laptop
and chemistry set ... all spread out haphazardly. Music: Soundgarden -- "Limo Wreck". Lynn and Daria are sprawled
across one unmade bed in the "something's eating at my soul position". AP's
working with the chemistry set at the vanity table. Jane walks in and heads
towards an easel set up in the corner, where a Pollack-esque canvas in purples
and greens are in progress. Jodie pokes her head through the door and her eyes
go wide.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jodie:</B> Guys ... sorry for asking, but did a bomb go
off in here?<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> I'm on it, GPA Girl.<BR><BR><B>Jodie:</B> (<I>a
little freaked</I>) I don't want to know. (<I>beat; as she tentatively
enters</I>) Still no word?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> The saying "no news is good
news" doesn't really apply when those who should deliver the news could be on a
slab in a Louisiana morgue, does it?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Careful, girl. You're
supposed to be a cynic, not a pessimist.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Yeah; that's
<B>her</B> job.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Hey, come on! She's not a pessimist <B>all</B>
the time.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> You're blackening my good name, AP. That's against
the Boyfriend Code.<BR><BR><B>Jodie:</B> She's right, you
know.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Boyfriend Code? Where's that stuff written down, anyway?
Jeez, even <B>my</B> stuff has manuals...<BR><BR>(<I>Lynn's phone starts
bleeping "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life". She digs it out of her
pocket, flips it open.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Cullen. (<I>beat</I>) WHAT?
(<I>beat</I>) Okay, okay, Nick, calm down and start at the
beginning.<BR><BR>(<I>All eyes in the room are on Lynn, who goes progressively
paler as Nick speaks.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Right. (<I>beat</I>) Oh. Okay.
Good. (<I>beat</I>) No, head north. You'll be met. (<I>beat</I>) No, you'll be
safe there. (<I>beat</I>) Medical I have no clue. (<I>Eyes widen at the mention
of "medical".</I>) Let me think -- what route are you taking? (<I>pause</I>)
Okay, it'll take you a little more time, but try passing through Pittsburgh --
NCM has some background in anatomy. (<I>beat</I>) Can you afford to be fussy?
(<I>beat</I>) How the hell should I know? I don't <B>deal</B> in corpses!
(<I>beat</I>) No, <B>I'm</B> sorry. Hopefully we'll see you there. (<I>beat</I>)
Yeah, but give us a half-hour. Luck.<BR><BR>(<I>She hangs up. Looks at the phone
for a moment. Then makes as if to throw it across the room. Then just tosses it
down on the bed. Then buries her head in her hands. There is a moment of silence
as Daria, Jane, AP and Jodie try to decide how to broach
this.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Lynn...<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> I don't want to have
to say this twice.<BR><BR>(<I>She gets up and walks out of the room. The others
look after her, then follow at a run.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: corridor.
Music plays on. Daria, Jane, Jodie and AP are following along in Lynn's wake. They're not
running but walking at a killing pace.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Not
Trent.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> No. Not Trent.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Thank
God.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Amen.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Who, then?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B>
Casualty lists should only have to be delivered once.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> You
told us about Trent...<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> You asked.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> I'm
not in the mood for twenty questions, Lynn.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Don't
<B>bother</B>, Erudite Emerald. Remember, stubborn as the day is
long.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Can't be Nick -- he was the one who
called.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Little Drummer Boy?<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Scar? What
about Jesse?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Stop <B>asking</B>! I'll tell you when I give
the damn report, now shut up!<BR><BR>(<I>She accelerates further, breaking into
a jog and outdistancing the others. They exchange a look but don't speed up
themselves.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: Slack's office. Music plays on. Lynn's standing to
near-military attention in front of Slack's desk. Slack is seated behind his
desk, Warlock is in one of the chair. As the group pile into the office, Fett
and a tall, skinny off-blond boy with grubby jeans and a beat-up T-shirt turn up
behind them.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Sitrep, Peril.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> I
got a phone call from Poppa Bear -- regarding the mission outside of New
Orleans.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Why not from Scar?<BR><BR>(<I>Lynn's face is
horribly expressionless as she speaks.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Because Karen
Willis is one of the casualties. Single bullet to the head. Probably sniped from
a high place. Reminiscent of what happened to Charles Ruttheimer III. There was
an ambush set up in the industrial estate parking lot. They turned the place
into a Roach Motel. Snoops check in, but they don't check
out.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> But they got the information?<BR><BR>(<I>There is
now a flicker of expression on Lynn's face -- unduluted rage the way only Lynn
can show it.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Can I finish the casualty list
<B>first</B>?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Go ahead.<BR><BR>(<I>A moment of silence.
Lynn schools to expressionlessness again.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Little
Drummer Boy took a bullet in the shoulder. Probably needs medical attention -- I
sent them via Pittsburgh in hopes that NCM knows enough about anatomy to at
least get the bullet out. (<I>beat</I>) And Jesse Moreno survived just past the
border out of Louisiana. Double-tapped to the chest.<BR><BR>(<I>There's a moment
of silence.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Oh God...<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> They're on
their way to Pittsburgh, then Detroit. <BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> An evac
<B>that</B> far north? That's nearly thirteen hundred miles,
Peril!<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> (<I>who's worked it out</I>) You want them coming
<B>here</B>? If they're being followed, they'd lead the Merritts straight to us.
This way, they've got thirteen thousand miles of road to lose pursuit
in.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> (<I>distant</I>) My brother's good at back
roads.<BR><BR>(<I>Lynn waits with strained patience as Warlock absorbs this --
he's obviously not sure he likes it, but there's not a lot he can say to dispute
it either. Then Lynn speaks as if she hasn't been
interrupted.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> They'll be briefing Chopper when they get
there -- Scar made sure that they <B>all</B> had the information before they
left the building. But they'll be calling back in (<I>checks watch</I>) ten
minutes or so. You can get what you need from them when they do.
<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Right. (<I>beat</I>) Someone needs to tell
Pagebert.<BR><BR>(<I>Warlock looks to his companions. None of them look very
thrilled about the idea. He turns next to Lynn, whose glare could
freeze.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Someone. Tell. Him.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> We
have our <B>own</B> dead to mourn. <B>You</B> tell him.<BR><BR>(<I>Daria puts an
arm around Jane's shoulders; the rest of them huddle around her and they leave
the room.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: the bar. Music: Silverchair -- "Emotion Sickness". Daria, Jane, Lynn, AP, Jodie and
Mack sit. There's rum -- two large bottles of it, obviously purloined from
behind the bar. One of them's mostly empty. There's also Coke -- three two-litre
bottles, one empty and the another about three-quarters full. None of them are
exactly sober, but Jane and Lynn are farther gone than the
others.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> It was really wrong to think that we'd get
away unscathed. But wasn't Tom enough of a blood sacrifice?<BR><BR><B>Mack:</B>
(<I>concerned; he's never seen Daria like this before</I>) I guess when the
business involves guns, you can't take anything for granted.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B>
He useta c'mover to the house when we were jus' kids. W'n I was li'l, he'd eat
m'artwork. (<I>beat</I>) 'N I rilly <B>liked</B> that toothpick sculpture,
too...<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> This must be <B>killing</B> Trent. (<I>beat</I>)
Thank God he got out, but at what price? I mean, what is he gonna do about the
band? (<I>beat</I>) What must they be thinking about this?<BR><BR><B>AP:</B>
Live fast? Die young? Leave a pretty corpse?<BR><BR><B>Jodie:</B> AP, that's
tactless!<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> And inaccurate. I wouldn't call a corpse full of
holes aesthetically pleasing.<BR><BR><B>Jodie:</B> DARIA!<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B>
Oh, when did <B>you</B> become my mother?<BR><BR><B>Jodie:</B> I'm not trying
to! I'm just ... Daria, you're <B>scaring</B> me!<BR><BR><B>AP:</B>
Y'<B>should</B> be scared, GPA Girl. That's two down now.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> 'M
gonna disem<B>bowel</B> those murdering pieces of...<BR><BR><B>Jodie:</B>
Jane!<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Lateral incision. Just below the navel. Then kick 'em
over backwards. Everything'll just fall out at that point.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B>
Good call, Lynn. Thanks for th'advice.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> What, no shocked and
outraged outcry at <B>her</B>?<BR><BR><B>Jodie:</B> Uh...<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> My
reputation precedes me. Whoop.<BR><BR><B>Mack:</B> So <B>now</B>
what?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> They got the info. Some've us go in
and...<BR><BR>(<I>She slams a fist down on the table <B>hard</B>. The nearly
empty bottle falls over, hits the floor and shatters. They all
jump.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> They won't let you. <BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Won't
<B>let</B>? Don't tell me about "won't <B>let</B>". A <B>year</B> now I've been
hangin' with 'em. I said no, they woul'n listen. They. Start. Listenin'.
<B>NOW</B>.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Will you get <B>over</B>
yourself?<BR><BR>(<I>The vehemence in her voice takes them <B>all</B>
back.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jodie:</B> Daria...<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> No, you shut up. I
don't know why you're in this now, but this isn't for you. (<I>to Lynn</I>)
Look, I'm upset too. And so's AP, right?<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Damn
straight.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> And so's Jane. And aside from her drunken,
ill-conceived disembowelment comment, <B>she</B> hasn't mentioned going out on a
revenge run, and she has more reason than you do to...<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B>
<B>Course</B> I din't mention. Goes without sayin', right?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B>
Jane, stand down and shut up; you're drunk.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> In vino veritas,
Daria...<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> We refer to this concoction as "lengua libre",
sis.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> (<I>dead cold</I>) Don't call me
that.<BR><BR>(<I>Silence greets this. Lynn goes
<B>white</B>.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Whoa, Erudite Em...<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B>
And <B>you</B> can shut up too. I'm not losing anyone else close to me to this.
You insist on taking stupid chances, fine. Consider yourself
disowned.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Fine.<BR><BR>(<I>She gets up, stalks out without a
sound. Everyone looks at Daria, except for Jane, who's about yay close to
passing out and probably didn't hear any of that
anyway.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Stop <B>looking</B> at me like
that.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Hell no! She's gonna take more chances than <B>ever</B>
if we're not there for buffer zone! For someone who they call a brain at school,
you're real damn stupid, y'know?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> AP, I
can't...<BR><BR>(<I>At which point he grabs her by the lapels of her jacket,
pulls her over to him until their faces are mere inches
apart.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> You're outta line, and you're bein' selfish, and
it's not <B>right</B> for now. You can be a bitch about it <B>later</B>. For
now, you wait until morning, and then you go to her and you tell her you didn't
mean it. <B>Grovel</B>, if you have to. But she's not gonna think that no one
gives a damn for her cos if she does, she's gonna die. You <B>want</B> that on
your head?<BR><BR>(<I>A lot of dead silence.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> You can
let go of me now.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Not until you tell me you're gonna take that
selfish ... that ... that <B>thing</B> you said
<B>back</B>.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> I'll ... think about...<BR><BR><B>AP:</B>
Don't <B>make</B> me hurt you, Daria.<BR><BR>(<I>More
silence.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jodie:</B> Daria, please. He's right. She needs
you.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Let. Me. Go.<BR><BR>(<I>AP thinks a minute, but he
doesn't let Daria go.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Mack, Jodie, grab Jane. That's
enougha this crap.<BR><BR>(<I>Jodie and Mack each get under one of Jane's arms
and haul her upright. AP, still dragging Daria by the jacket, leads the way
out.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: hotel corridor. Music plays on. AP approaches the door to room
320, still holding Daria by the jacket.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> (<I>rummaging
in a pocket for her key</I>) I may have had a couple of drinks, AP, but I was
perfectly able to find my own room.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Sure; I know. But
<B>you're</B> not going in there.<BR><BR>(<I>With that, he hammers on the door.
A moment later, Quinn, wearing the pyjamas we saw her wearing in "Admission:
Impossible", opens it; she looks pissed off.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Daria,
you <B>have</B> a key! <B>Some</B> of us <B>care</B> about getting beauty
sleep...<BR><BR>(<I>AP lets uses the hand he knocked on the door with to reach
into the pocket of Jane's shirt, pulling something out. Then he nods to Mack and
Jodie.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Okay, dump her.<BR><BR>(<I>Jodie and Mack, after
sharing a look, start hauling Jane into the room.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B>
Excuse me...<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> What are you <B>doing</B>? Oh my <B>God</B>,
how much has she had to...<BR><BR><B>Jodie:</B> Enough so that you'd get drunk
just from her breathing on you.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Oh, no, I'm <B>not</B>
sharing with her! What if she throws up on my clothes?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B>
It'll be alternative.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Alternative's for freaks like
<B>you</B>! And where are <B>you</B> gonna sleep?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Good
question. But the way I'm being dragged suggests a neanterthal mating ritual,
so...<BR><BR>(<I>AP drags her off. Quinn looks after them in shock. Jodie and
Mack come out, looking a little freaked.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> What is going
<B>on</B>?<BR><BR>(<I>Off Jodie and Mack's shared look, cut
to...</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: further down the corridor; in front of room
316. Music plays on. Daria sees where this is heading and her expression indicates that she
doesn't like it very much.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> If you think the "lock them
in the same room" routine is going to work, you've been watching way too many
teenybopper sitcoms.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> I'm not going to play word games with
you., cos I'm not gonna lose this one.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> How can you? You're
not even blood-related to her, and you can still...<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> I
<B>love</B> her. (<I>beat</I>) Like it or not, so do you.<BR><BR>(<I>Without
ceremony, he unlocks the door, throws her in and shuts it behind her -- not
slamming it but shutting it gently, in case Lynn's asleep. Then he leans back on
it with a sigh.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: Jane and Lynn's room. Music: Something for Kate -- "Photograph". Daria stands
with her back to the door, looking in at the shambles the room has become. Lynn
is curled up on the bed, dead to the world. Daria watches her for a long moment,
then walks over to where Lynn lies. Lynn still doesn't stir, but Daria notices
that there's a balled-up tissue sticking out of Lynn's fist -- that and the
redness around her eyes indicates that she only got to sleep because she cried
herself into it.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> (<I>a whisper; doesn't really want to
wake Lynn</I>) Hey ... Lynn?<BR><BR>(<I>No response. Daria notices something
else -- a small photo album on the bed in front of Lynn's head. Daria picks it
up and moves to the unmade bed Jane's been using, where she starts flipping
through it. The first one she sees gives her pause -- it's a photo of a very
young Lynn and a younger Jerome, both wearing Boston Bruins jerseys [Lynn's is
grossly oversized], sitting in hockey stadium seating beside various obvious
Dallas Stars supporters who are looking at them <B>very</B> strangely. Jerome's
arm is around his daughter's shoulders and they look very
close.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> It hit her hard; they were close until
then...<BR><BR>(<I>She voices a sigh, then flips the page. It's Lynn and AP in
their silly mouse ears, brandishing water guns, as they stand somewhere in the
Wild West area of Disneyworld. Then a shot of Lynn as we first saw her sitting
in a pub with a small group of people; one is Jan in an oversized Habs jersey
but we don't know the others [buxom curly-haired brunette with glasses and a
sexy smirk, a tall, sturdy off-blond, a small, skinny girl with lank pale hair
and a swarthy girl with mid-length black hair in spiral curls and a big smile].
Then a shot of Daria, Jane, Lynn and AP in their Matrix-esque leather dusters,
standing in front of the A-Tank in badass poses. Daria gives a very sad little
smile, flips the page again ... and starts a little as a folded piece of paper
falls out. She picks it up, unfolds it and looks at it, her eyes going
wide.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> (<I>whisper</I>) The blood test
results?<BR><BR>(<I>She flips it over. In Lynn's looping handwriting, are these
simple words: "Finally -- family I can rely on." When we look at Daria again,
she is trembling a little as she folds it up and puts it back behind a picture
of Daria and Jane at the "Trick or Trent" halloween party. She keeps going
through the photo album -- the shot of Daria and Lynn dragging Jane out of the
Tate Gallery; the black-and-white promo shot of Mystik Spiral; an onstage shot
of Lynn and AP as Romeo and Juliet, kissing; the gang in their Rocky Horror
outfits ... and then a screen capture, printed on photo paper -- Daria and Lynn
sitting around a campfire. If you didn't know the backstory, you'd think they
were typical sisters on a camping trip. Daria lingers over this last, then looks
at Lynn, considering ... then shuts the photo album quietly and puts it back
where she got it. She brushes a strand of hair out of Lynn's face in an almost
tender gesture.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> (<I>very quiet</I>) My sister, the
sentimentalist. (<I>beat</I>) But I won't let it get
around.<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Black screen. White writing reads, "26 December 2000".

standing in front of the closed bathroom door, looking
first-thing-in-the-morning dishevelled and completely pissed off. There's a
knock at the door. Quinn goes over and opens it; Jodie's standing
there.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jodie:</B> How's Jane?<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B>
Ewwwwww...<BR><BR><B>Jodie:</B> (<I>raised eyebrow</I>) That good,
huh?<BR><BR>(<I>Puking sounds from the bathroom. Quinn rolls her
eyes.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> It's been like <B>that</B> since, like, five in
the <B>morning</B>. Why couldn't she have stayed in her <B>own</B>
room?<BR><BR><B>Jodie:</B> Cos Daria and Lynn needed to
talk.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> God, what is <B>wrong</B> with them? I mean, like, is
it <B>really</B> a good idea to be fighting or whatever when there's <B>this</B>
stuff going on?<BR><BR><B>Jodie:</B> No it's not. But sometimes the stress gets
to you, I guess. They'll get over it once they've calmed
down.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Oh, <B>please</B>. Daria holds a grudge
for<B>ever</B>. She doesn't really get over <B>anything</B>! They won't be
talking for, like, <B>weeks</B>.<BR><BR>(<I>Daria and Lynn poke their heads
around the open door.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria &amp; Lynn:</B> (<I>unison</I>) How's

noise and walks right out of the room, with Daria and Lynn watching her with
confused eyes. Then they look to Jodie, who shrugs.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: a

it up.<BR><BR><B>Slack:</B> You're thinking high

be.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Right. (<I>dials his cellphone</I>) NCM? Warlock.
Right, I'm going to put Incubus on in a sec. (<I>beat</I>) We've got a bomb for
you to build.<BR><BR>(<I>He hands the phone to Incubus, turns to

exit</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: Jane and Lynn's room. Music plays on. The entire group is
crammed in there, just hanging out. Enter Warlock, and Lynn sits up to something
that would be attention in anyone else. The others watch her, seem bemused but
follow her example.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> We're moving out
tonight.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Moving <B>where</B>? I thought we were here for
our safety.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> From everything but really bad
architecture.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> This whole thing is moving north. We have a
safe house about 40 miles out from River Rouge...<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Because
you're "sick of this". And "we're taking the fight to those
bastards".<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Remind me to talk to Slack about sweeping for
bugs.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> I might as well, since it's not going to do me any
good to have them anymore.<BR><BR><B>Jodie:</B> You're putting us <B>closer</B>
to the fight?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Yes and no. You, you (<I>points to
Mack</I>) and Little Drummer Boy are going to stay in Chopper's place in Royal
Oak. <BR><BR><B>Mack:</B> But what about <B>them</B>?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> We're
out <B>there</B> because <B>some</B> of us will be helping with the pre-game
preparation.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Knock-out gas? EMP? FAE -- oh, and you're goin'
about that kinda dumb anyway -- you don't go to the right
sites...<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> <B>And</B> it's easy enough to defend. Just in
case.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> And you want Nick and Trent in on
this?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> I spoke to them. They won't be left out. (<I>beat;
ignoring Lynn's accusatory look</I>) Get packed. We move out in two
hours.<BR><BR>(<I>Warlock exits; they watch him go. Then Lynn gets up and pulls
out her rucksack, jamming things into it at nearly random. They watch
her.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>not looking up; nearly bitter</I>) Well? You
heard the man. Oh, and AP, could you pack the stuff Trent left? I'll come help
when I'm done.<BR><BR>(<I>Jane gets up, grabs her bag and starts reaching for
her clothes. Daria, Quinn, AP, Mack and Jodie leave as
well.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> What about Nick and Max's stuff?
And...<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: AP and Trent's room. AP is stuffing what appears to
be a last T-shirt of his into his bag; he snaps it shut and looks at Trent's
half of the room.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> (<I>OS</I>) Need some
help?<BR><BR>(<I>AP looks at her a bit oddly as she enters the room and picks up
a green T-shirt of Trent's. She starts folding it, then gives up and throws it
on the bed, picking up a pair of jeans next and giving it the same
treatment.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Where's Purple Peril?<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B>
(<I>not looking up</I>) She went to get the other stuff. Nick's. Max's.

Trent's clothes off the floor.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Oh. (<I>beat</I>)
Yeah.<BR><BR>(<I>A moment later, he starts helping her pick stuff
up.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Black writing. White writing reads, "28 December 2000".
Fade up to...</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Establishing shot: a large ranch-style house
on a substantial plot of land. In front of the house are parked the BWV, a
four-door grey Honda, the A-Tank, the Merc, a blue-green Chevy Cavalier -- in
short, the front of the place looks like a used-car lot.</I>)<BR><BR>(<I>Scene:
house front hall. The group are assembled with their luggage -- it's quite
crowded. It's also somewhat ramshackle. The kids look around a bit
uncertainly.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> I can usually find something artistic
about <B>anything</B>.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> And...<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Notice I
said "usually".<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> I think safety's more at issue here than
decor. And if everything goes well, you won't be staying here
long.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> So now what?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> There's a dining
area that should do for a workshop and lab. Go set up there.<BR><BR>(<I>AP

out.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Pagebert? Incubus?<BR><BR>(<I>Incubus takes the
crate off AP, who looks at him gratefully. Pagebert collects up his own gear and
they leave the room. Warlock looks at Lynn, who's digging through a fairly large
crate.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> What are you up to?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B>
Surveillance. A few well-placed hidden cameras in area streetlights, that kind
of thing. We have no idea how much Remora leaked. This is one of the places
Chopper set up, right? Long-established?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> ...Point. But
take Fett with you. You'll need some cover. (<I>beat</I>) And take the Blow Job
Bus.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Ex<B>cuse</B> me?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> I'll let
<B>him</B> explain.<BR><BR>(<I>Lynn raises an eyebrow at Warlock, then steps

Warlock shakes his head.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: ranch house room;
practically bare. Music: The Saints -- "Everything's Fine". There are bits of luggage and weapons scattered around the
place. There are a few mismatched chairs and a table battered worse than that in
the LHS staff lounge, but that's all in the way of furniture. The walls are
dingy. Daria, Jane, Lynn, AP and Quinn are seated around the table, holding
cards. The rest of the deck sits on the table next to a substantial pile of
change. Only Quinn has more than four cards in their hands; she has
eight.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Got any fives?<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> (<I>grin</I>)
Gooooooooo fish!<BR><BR>(<I>Quinn fishes, groans in disgust and drops a quarter
onto the pile.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> UGH! What the hell am I doing playing
Go Fish ... and, like, for <B>money</B> and stuff?<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Listen,
princess, we're exactly forty miles from <B>nowhere</B>. You got any
<B>better</B> ideas?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Or would you rather I loan you a book?
If you liked the Iliad, you'd <B>love</B> the Odyssey.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B>
Daria, <B>ew</B>! You're not going to trick me like that again! (<I>beat</I>)
Anyway, <B>I</B> heard the Odyssey was silly. That witch who turns guys into
pigs ... Circa or whatever...<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> I think you mean
Circe.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> What<B>ever</B>. Anyway, what I heard about her
reminds me too much of Sandi.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> You know what we never
did?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Spent Christmas in our family's homes like normal
people?<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Hey, <B>I</B> did that last
year!<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Well, I <B>meant</B> exchanging Christmas
gifts.<BR><BR>(<I>Lynn and AP exchange a look. Daria sees it and smirks a
little. Jane sees the nonverbal exchange and gives a smirk of her
own.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> I take it I stand corrected?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B>
We never ... really ... finished the exchange, I have to
admit.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Oooh-la-laaaa... Sounds like more than presents got
unwrapped.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> I begin to see why you appealed to me.
Familiarity.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Run that one past me one more
time?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Either that or you've been dating Goat-boy too long.
You sound more like Mara every day.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> I'm going to take
offense to that.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Hey, I wanna hear more about the presents!
(<I>to the looks</I>) I <B>like</B> getting presents, okay?<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Fade
to: the same, some time later. Music plays on. They are sitting in the same spots, but with
crudely-wrapped presents [the paper is obvious scrap -- old newspaper, used
printer paper, brown paper bags...] before them in small
stacks.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Okay, how do we start?<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B>
Me?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>tossing a box wrapped in white paper</I>) Here; now
shut up.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> (<I>stunned</I>) <B>You</B> got me
something?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> What part of "shut up" don't you
understand?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> In that case ... Lynn, this is
yours.<BR><BR>(<I>She hands over a package. AP wordlessly hands one to Daria.
Jane hands one to AP. Jane looks to Quinn, who shrugs. Without a word, they open
the presents.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> (<I>holding up a Geography textbook</I>)
It's ... it's ... (<I>beat</I>) going to be useful?<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Open
it.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> (<I>doing so; flipping through</I>) The pages are
blank.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Was Purple Peril's idea. Had it made special after you
saw Mommy McBeal going through your room. A diary she'd never bother
touching.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> That was ... really thoughtful. Thank
you.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> (<I>to Jane</I>) Nice etchwork on the glass. (<I>he holds
up an Erlenmeyer flask with the words, "Li'l Bastard" etched into it</I>) You
could market these at Bob's Bargain Basement.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Like I have
the time to make as many as I'd need.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>holding up a book
with a grinning Dustpuppy on the cover</I>) "Evil Genius for Dummies". I'm sure
I'm going to be disappointed.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Lynn, these earrings are
<B>great</B>! God, if you have such good taste, how can you dress like
<B>that</B>?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> I kept the receipt for them.<BR><BR>(<I>Quinn's
hands close protectively over the box and her lips tighten. Lynn smirks and
hands a package to Daria. Daria hands one to AP. AP to Jane. Jane to Lynn. Quinn
just shrugs again, but actually watches with some interest as the packages are
opened.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> A purple satin negligee, edged in black lace.
(<I>beat</I>) This strikes me as being more for AP than for
me.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> The gift that keeps on giving! And speaking of; hey, this
was on my wish list!<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> "Whoomp, There It Is -- Advanced
Bathtub Explosives"?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> No; they were out of
stock.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> "Pheromones to Psychopharmacology -- Fun With

little red tube that looks like a marker</I>) What <B>are</B>
these?<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Portable graffiti pens! Easy to hide, and indelible!

resulting from parental concern has been highlighted.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> You
always get me something useful, don't you?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> I don't deal in
frivolities if I can avoid it.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Does that mean no sexy satin
thing?<BR><BR>(<I>Lynn throws a package at him to shut him up, but gives a
little sly smirk as she does. AP shyly hands over a parcel to Lynn. Daria and
Jane, without a word, exchange gifts. Quinn now looks <B>very</B> put
out.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> (<I>noticing; picking up a small flat parcel</I>)
Oh, here.<BR><BR>(<I>Quinn takes it from her delicately and starts unwrapping it
as the others do the same. Lynn holds the little box AP produced on Christmas
eve and unwraps it to reveal a little velvet box. She doesn't even open it --
she just looks at him.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> How did you
know?<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Saw you outside the store?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B>
(<I>looking around her</I>) I ... uh ... excuse me.<BR><BR>(<I>She gets up and
walks out. The others look after her.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> What's wrong
with <B>her</B>?<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Every Christmas, this happens. She
<B>really</B> doesn't deal well with nice presents, does
she?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> So how nice <B>is</B> nice? Were diamonds
involved?<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> (<I>wide-eyed</I>) Come <B>on</B>, Erudite Emerald;
I'm thinking high school and college and crap <B>first</B>, okay? (<I>picking up
the box</I>) I got her these.<BR><BR>(<I>He opens the box to show them two pairs
of earrings -- one set of very small amethyst studs and one pair of amethyst
teardrop pendant earrings set in white gold. They all
stare.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> God, <B>why</B> won't you people show this
taste <B>all</B> the time?!?<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> How'd you <B>pay</B> for
these?<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> (<I>shrug</I>) Royalties. The Methods sell pretty good,
y'know.<BR><BR>(<I>Re-enter Lynn, composed -- almost military posture --
carrying a Bat'leth. Now they stare at <B>her</B>.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B>
(<I>eyes lowered</I>) I ran into Warlock. Scar'd already got it for
me.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> They got you <B>Christmas
presents</B>?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Remember my birthday? (<I>beat</I>) I'm
Family, remember?<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> (<I>miffed</I>) A coupon for "Books by
the <B>Ton</B>"?<BR><BR>(<I>That breaks the tension somewhat and they all look
at Daria with congratulatory smirks.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: ranch house
dining room. Music: Tom Lehrer -- "Who's Next?" AP's rather impressive chemistry set is set up at one end of a vast
dining table. The rest of the table is littered with firearms, Warlock's bow and
a few items that look very familiar to any fan of ST:TNG. As Warlock goes over
the firearms with an assessing eye, AP grabs one of the items and
gawks.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> It's a phaser! It's a phaser! (<I>beat as he grabs
it up and examines it minutely</I>) It's a <B>phaser</B>! (<I>looking up</I>)
Who built a phaser?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Read the tag,
Maverick.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> (<I>reading aloud but not ahead</I>) "Type I
experimental laser pistol [prototype]. Capacity: 2 shots. Allow five minutes
cooldown between shots. After second shot, dispose of with haste and take cover;
overload and explosion imminent." (<I>blink blink</I>) Where's my
Leatherman?<BR><BR>(<I>Without looking up, he grabs a random tool [small
flathead screwdriver, as it happens], pops the cover and starts
digging.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Maverick, what are you
doing?<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Seeing how this thing...<BR><BR>(<I>*ZAP* -- the thing
discharges a bolt of laser fire and burns a peephole in the wall. By the angle,
it also probably singed Warlock's hair a little. AP doesn't even seem to notice
-- he's still digging around in the guts of the
"phaser".</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Nice hole in the wall.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B>
(<I>still not looking up</I>) Give me two seconds. (<I>He fiddles with the
circuits and wiring for a moment</I>) Okaaaaay ... this should give two minutes
cooldown and a total of three shots, <B>plus</B> a thirty second margin before
the thing goes <B>boom</B>.<BR><BR>(<I>He tosses it to Warlock, who blinks at
the contraption as he turns it over in his hands. Then he stares at the
boy.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> You <B>sure</B>, Maverick?<BR><BR><B>AP:</B>
(<I>offhand</I>) Oh yeah. Well, could be more like 45 seconds, but I'd have it
out of my hands in thirty. <BR><BR>(<I>He picks up another "it's-a-phaser" and
starts tinkering with the components.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> (<I>to
Pagebert, sotto</I>) I see why the Falcon wanted <B>him</B> so
bad...<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> (<I>looking up</I>) So if you guys have phasers... does
that mean you have... lightsabres? Do you? Do you?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Not
yet. We can't control the laser beam.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> (<I>sulking</I>) Nuts.
(<I>beat</I>) Can I have a look? CanIcanIcanI?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> It's
basically one of these (<I>indicating phaser</I>) in a hilt instead of a pistol.
And no, you can't. They tend to explode.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> (<I>*sigh*</I>) You
never let me have ANY fun! Anyway, the Ratman knew jack about the light sabre
thing. It's not laser -- it's a plasma thing. Loops back on itself and there's a
teeny air gap but the problem is where the hilt overheats and the whole thing
goes <B>boom</B>...<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Whoa whoa whoa. Talk to Incubus about
this. But later -- let's focus on the weapons that we know
work.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Aw, fine. (<I>beat; eyes go wide as he remembers
something.</I>) DOWN!<BR><BR>(<I>Warlock doesn't question; he just dives,
hitting Pagebert and taking him down with him. AP is about to dive when Daria
and Jane step in.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Hey, wha...<BR><BR><B>AP:</B>
GET...<BR><BR>(<I>*BANG* -- something in a flask on the table blows sky-high and
Daria and Jane dive out of the room as AP just drops. There's a moment where the
only sounds are the hissing of smouldering wood and the coughing as the smoke
from whatever blew up hits people's lungs. Then Daria and Jane poke their heads
back in.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Let me see if I remember this one. Method ...

collect his pay and vanished without a trace...<BR><BR><B>Refugee:</B> Probably
to go after that Maverick kid, after he turned Bill's head into ground
chuck...<BR><BR>(<I>Norton slams his palms on the desk as he propels himself to
a standing position -- the rage and frustration apparently has him approaching
apoplexy.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Norton:</B> SHUT UP! The point is, these are
<B>kids</B>! We're being one-upped by <B>kids</B>! You couldn't even take down a
couple of high school brats!<BR><BR><B>Refugee:</B> Warlock showed! What the
hell was <B>I</B> supposed to...<BR><BR><B>Norton:</B> You were <B>supposed</B>
to put them in the <B>ground</B>!<BR><BR>(<I>Pause while Norton collects
himself; he sits down again and fixes his gaze on the desk. Refugee wisely
doesn't speak until the calming process has apparently been
completed.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Refugee:</B> I want another
shot.<BR><BR><B>Norton:</B> You'll get it.<BR><BR><B>Refugee:</B>
Solo?<BR><BR><B>Norton:</B> No. Get a team together. The South is compromised,
so you won't be going far.<BR><BR><B>Refugee:</B> Where?<BR><BR><B>Norton:</B>
From what I know of their current head, they'll be hiding somewhere in plain
sight, and quite close...<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Black screen. White writing reads, "29
December, 2000". Fade up to...</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: Norton Steelworks. Music: Hole -- "Awful". Close
in on a building within the compound. A grey van marked with the words "Three
Chicks in Black Jackets Delivery Service" is parked outside. Aph and DJ, both
with black ball caps as well as the black jackets, exit the back with a crate.
Leopard, bare-headed but with the ubiquitous black jacket, approaches the door
and pushes an intercom button.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Intercom:</B> State your
business.<BR><BR><B>Leopard:</B> Three Chicks in Black
Jackets.<BR><BR><B>Intercom:</B> I said <B>business</B>, not
name.<BR><BR><B>Leopard:</B> Consignment of eggnog?<BR><BR><B>Intercom:</B>
Little late for Christmas, ain'tcha, girlie?<BR><BR><B>Leopard:</B> Hey, I don't
make the orders, dude -- I just deliver.<BR><BR>(<I>Pause. Door opens. Aph and
DJ hand over the crate to a fairly burly brute of a man, who takes it easily and
puts it down inside the door. Leopard hands him a clipboard and pen, which
disappears in his fist as he makes to sign the form. She nods at him and heads
back to the van with the others; they get into the back as she heads behind the
wheel and drives off at a sedate speed.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Bruiser:</B> Eggnog.
Ugh.<BR><BR>(<I>He shuts the door.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: long shot of the
compound. Music plays on. In the immediate foreground is bwv. The first thing that happens is
that the lights go out; the second thing is a not-so-muffled explosion and the
pretty comprehensive destruction of the building. Warlock, standing outside
bwv's passenger side door, lights a fire-arrow and launches it into the
air.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> I shot an arrow in the
air.<BR><BR><B>Pagebert:</B> (<I>from in bwv</I>) It came to earth ... somewhere
back there?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> It landed in a Merritt's
hair.<BR><BR><B>Pagebert:</B> Now let's give 'em more than a
scare.<BR><BR>(<I>Warlock clambers into bwv and shuts the door. It drives off
towards the now-buzzing compound; we can see from the angle that other vehicles
-- the A-Tank, Fett's BJB, NCM's car and the grey van -- are all converging on
the compound.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: ranch house sitting room. The Superjesus -- "Strips of You". Quinn's
sitting in a big, ratty wingback chair, doing her nails and idly watching a
juryrigged bank of surveillance screens. Enter Daria.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B>
You want to be relieved from watch?<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Nah; that'd mean I'd
have to go out there and maybe be nice to you guys and I'm not very good at that
-- I'm not like you guys and you weird me out.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Fair enough.
(<I>beat</I>) All quiet on the western front?<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> So far, yeah.
I mean, you <B>really</B> think those guys're gonna find us out in the middle of
<B>nowhere</B>?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Better to have a battle plan and not need
it than need it and not have it. (<I>beat</I>) Do you know what to do if they
<B>do</B>?<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> <B>Duh</B>, Daria! I help beat their faces in
and ruin my manicure!<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> In this case, Quinn, it's your
Apricot Shimmer or your <B>life</B>.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> I <B>know</B>. I'm not
<B>that</B> shallow. (<I>beat</I>) Daria?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B>
Yeah?<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> I'm really <B>not</B> that shallow ... am
I?<BR><BR>(<I>Pause as Daria thinks about this.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Not as
much as even <B>you</B> like to think sometimes.<BR><BR>(<I>She walks out. Quinn
smiles a little and goes back to the surveillance.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene:
ranch house living room. Music plays on. AP's pacing, toying with an "it's a phaser". He stuffs
it in a pocket and keeps pacing, shooting Lynn [who's calmly loading her gun]
little looks ever now and then. Then, taking a breath to steady his nerves, he
stalks over to the sofa and sits down next to her.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Purple
Peril?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>not looking up</I>) Yeah?<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> I ...
I dunno how we're gonna come out of this ... and I thought ... before it kicks
off... (<I>deep breath</I>) I gotta tell you something.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B>
(<I>looking at him -- sensing this is important</I>) I'm
listening.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Purple Per ... Lynn... I never said it, even after
you did and... (<I>*sigh*</I>) I love you. Have since I was nine. No matter
what, I'll never love anyone so much. Ever.<BR><BR>(<I>Short pause. Lynn just
looks at him.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> (<I>getting nervous</I>) I ... I'd've said
it in prettier words, but ... well, YOU know how I am ... I... (<I>nervous
swallow</I>) PLEASE say something...<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>fighting tears</I>)
Oh, AP...<BR><BR>(<I>She kisses him and then just grabs him in a tight hug. Pan
to Daria and Jane at the other end of the room.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Awwwww.
Isn't that sweet.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Positively cavity-inducing. If I were a
diabetic, I'd be in a coma by now.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Does this mean that this
is the time to make any of those last-minute confessions or do the soul-bearing
thing?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Well, if we don't and things turn out wrong, we
could regret those unsaid words for the rest of our lives. (<I>beat</I>) But
then again, in this situation there's some comfort in that "the rest of our
lives" wouldn't actually be all that long.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Daria?
(<I>beat</I>) I'm scared.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Me too, Jane. (<I>beat;
quiet</I>) Thank you for being my friend.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> (<I>equally
quiet</I>) Thank you for being mine.<BR><BR>(<I>They reach for each other's
hands at the same moment, squeeze once and then let
go.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> (<I>OS</I>) They're COMING!<BR><BR>(<I>That makes
for a shocked silence.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> (<I>dry to hide the fear</I>)
Of course they are. If we hid in Antarctica, we'd find guys in penguin suits
pointing guns at our heads.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>approaching Daria</I>) If
she can see them, we have a minute. Come on; let's check this
out.<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: ranch house front porch; suitably fortified. Music plays on. The gang
are watching a dustcloud suggesting at least three cars approaching at some
speed.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Huh. I do believe Birnam Wood is coming to
Dunsinane Hill.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> You HAVE been hanging out with Warlock too
long.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Or Mr. O'Neill.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> No, that had a
more Warlock-like maliciousness to it.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Can we stop NOW? BEFORE
they start shooting at us?<BR><BR>(<I>At the dry <B>crack</B> of a gunshot,
everybody flattens themselves.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>dry</I>) Too
late.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> (<I>OS</I>) Do I have to say it <B>again</B>? They're
<B>COMING</B>!<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Gee. Y'think?<BR><BR>(<I>They re-enter the
house and shut the door. The sound several heavy-duty locks being shot home can
be heard over the low growl of approaching engines.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene:
Fortress of Cynicism, basement. Window is jimmied open, causing no alarms to
sound. Wily [the goon we encounter a few times in ToD] clambers in through the
window, lowers himself ... and drops. There is a <B>splash</B> as he
hits.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Wily:</B> What the...<BR><BR>(<I>Four other Merritts follow
him through -- same splash -- and we pan down to see that all five men are up to
their knees in water. They look at each other, a little
dubiously.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Wily:</B> (<I>impatient</I>) It's just rising damp.
Come on.<BR><BR>(<I>The Merritts wade forward a few paces ... then stop at a
burst of light and sound from somewhere above them. Music [the sudden burst of
sound]: "Disposable Teens" - Marilyn Manson. They look up; there's a sort of
balcony/walkway at one edge of the basement, with stairs leading from it to the
door to the main house, and on it stand Daria, Jane, Lynn and AP, all totally
deadpan. Lynn has one boot on a plugged-in TV [hooked to a long extension cord],
which is playing the video [and song] 'Disposable Teens'. Cut briefly to the
Merritts, who look nervous. The music hits crescendo and Lynn, waring an evil
smirk echoed to at least some degree by the others, kicks the TV off the
platform into the water-filled basement below. Music plays on, but we hear that
nasty electrocution buzz and a cathode ray tube blowing up as the foursome
watch, the smirks being slowly replaced by trepidatious looks. They steel
themselves and walk away towards the door to the main
stronghold.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: entry hall. Music plays on. Outside, it
sounds like World War III in progress; things are blowing up and there is
screaming.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> What is going <B>on</B>
out...<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Don't ask.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B>
But...<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Okay, you know your positions. Go for
it.<BR><BR>(<I>They scatter.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: a spare bedroom. Music
plays on. AP corners Quinn and hands her a phaser.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Now,
treat this like a pre-Bubble Boy guy, okay?<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> What are you
<B>talking</B> about?<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Use once, throw
away.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> But ... wha ... HEY!<BR><BR>(<I>AP grins and dashes
off. Quinn looks at the phaser.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: an upstairs corridor
-- more like a wide balcony with a door in it. Music plays on. Quinn's head
appears around a doorframe. She looks one way, then the other, and then her eyes
widen; she retreats as shots are fired in her direction. She comes back out like
a Valkyrie, all fury, with the phaser held out in front of
her.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> You singed my <B>hair</B> with
that!<BR><BR>(<I>She fires once, then drops it as she retreats into the room.
Refugee watches as a man named Burns walks up and picks up the gun. He fires it
once at the door, making a hole in it at about Quinn-head
level.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Refugee:</B> Nice toy there.<BR><BR><B>Burns:</B>
Coooooool!<BR><BR>(<I>Burns stuffs it in its jacket and backs up, preparing to
make a rush at the door.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Refugee:</B> Do you smell something
burni- <BR><BR>(<I>Refugee and the other two mooks catch on fast and run around
a corner; we follow them as, a moment later, we hear a muffled BOOM from the
spot they formerly occupied. They peer around the corner; we see their faces but
not the result.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Mook 2:</B> Eww. Burns
bits.<BR><BR><B>Refugee:</B> Don't you mean "burned" bits?<BR><BR><B>All</B>:
Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> (<I>OS</I>) Yeah, you can say
<B>that</B> again!<BR><BR><B>Refugee:</B> You two get her.<BR><BR><B>Mook 2:</B>
Where are <B>you</B> going?<BR><BR><B>Refugee:</B> Unfinished business. I got
someone to ... (<I>gun-to-head gesture</I>) take care of.<BR><BR>(<I>He walks
off. The two Merritts look at each other, then turn the
corner.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: a downstairs corridor. Music: Iced Earth -- "Vengeance is Mine". Lynn and AP defining
another doorway. It's quiet for the time being -- she has her gun and he has
another "it's a phaser", which he fires once and then tosses down the
hall.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Why'd you do that?!<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Because
it's about to ex- <BR><BR>(<I>BOOM! Again, we don't see the end-result, but we
see spatter.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Oh. (<I>beat</I>) THAT! Is an
EX-PHASER!<BR><BR>(<I>AP turns to look down the hallway at the carnage he's just
caused, and Lynn takes the opportunity to slip away from him while his back's
turned.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> And bereft of life, they rest in pieces. (<I>he
waits for a laugh, doesn't get one and turns to find Lynn missing.</I>) Hey!
Purple Peril! Where'd ya go? (<I>beat; it hits</I>) Awwww ... Purple PERIL! You
PROMISED me you wouldn't DO this crap!<BR><BR>(<I>Gunshots; AP ducks and
runs.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: basement training area. Music plays on. Refugee opens the door
and enters carefully. It looks deserted. He enters, looking curiously at the
swords mounted on the walls -- epee, broadsword, shortsword, katana. He takes
the katana out of the wall rack and unsheaths it. Then he whirls as the door
slams and locks. Behind it stands Lynn, pocketing a key. For a moment, they just
look at each other. He pulls his gun, and so does she --
stalemate.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> You really want to settle it this way? Who
can squeeze a trigger first? Hardly a challenge, is it?<BR><BR><B>Refugee:</B>
You that anxious to die, kid?<BR><BR>(<I>She just looks at him. Then she lowers
the gun. He does the same, then holds up the katana.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B>
Better.<BR><BR>(<I>She reaches behind her and pulls the bat'leth. Both take
attack stances.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: the upstairs corridor. The walls are
scorched and there's ... viscera. Quinn and Jane are standing back-to-back in
the centre of the narrow hallway-cum-balcony, blocking the door with the "it's a
phaser" hole in it.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Why are we doing this
again?<BR><BR>(<I>She kicks one approaching Merritt in the stomach and sends him
into the nearest wall.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Daria's got something going in
there.<BR><BR>(<I>Jane slashes out at an approaching mook and sends him over the
side.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Like <B>what</B>? Oh, go left!<BR><BR>(<I>As she
says that last, she grabs the wrist of an approaching mook and kicks him in the
head as she throws him. Since Jane's dodged left, he goes flying into another
mook who was approaching Jane with a baseball bat. Instead, he drops it on his
head as they both stagger backwards, out cold.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Not sure
I want to know.<BR><BR>(<I>There are three knocks on the door to their left, a
pause, then two more.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Come on!<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B>
Wha...?<BR><BR>(<I>Jane has grabbed Quinn by the shoulder and thrown Quinn
through the suddenly opened door they've been guarding. A small canister rolls
out and the door slams shut. The mooks look at it...</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene:
a small, ratty guest bedroom. Daria is stuffing a blanket into the crack at the
bottom of the door. A towel has already been stuffed into the hole the "it's a
phaser" made.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> What is going <B>on</B>?<BR><BR>(<I>The
sound of several bodies hitting the floor is heard out in the
corridor.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> AP's knock-out spray. We wait a few minutes
and it should have dispersed.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> But <B>then</B> what do we do
with them?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> At least get them out of here. Let them take
their chances with the obstacle course outside.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B>
<B>Obstacle</B> course?<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Land mines.<BR><BR>(<I>Quinn stares;
Daria lowers her eyes.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: Merritt inner sanctum. Music: Catch 22 -- "Keasbey Nights". Ram is
holding a glass of wine in one hand and a packet of some powder in the other.
From the other side of his door come sounds of gunshots, the odd scream and
incoherent shouted orders. Ram pours the packet into the wine glass and sloshes
it around a bit to dissolve. He toasts no one in particular ... and the door
bangs open. In the moment Ram's frozen in shock, the wine glass gets shot out of
his hand. In the doorway stand Fett and Warlock, with Nick and Trent covering
them. All four enter the room, weapons trained on
Norton.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Norton:</B> Nice of you to join me.<BR><BR><B>Fett:</B>
This war is <B>over</B>.<BR><BR><B>Norton:</B> Oh, I agree with you entirely
there. (<I>slight smirk</I>) It's just a question of who
won.<BR><BR><B>Nick:</B> Looks like us from where I'm standing, hey
Trent?<BR><BR><B>Trent:</B> (<I>icy smile</I>) Looks like.<BR><BR><B>Norton:</B>
Of course, you <B>do</B> realise why you found it so easy to get
in?<BR><BR><B>Fett:</B> We don't listen to this bullshit.<BR><BR>(<I>Fett cocks
his guns [Colt 1911As, if memory serves]. Warlock glares at him and Fett holds
his hand ... for now.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> You sent the rest of your men
elsewhere?<BR><BR><B>Norton:</B> That secluded little hideaway you stored the
Falcon's fledgeling in.<BR><BR><B>Trent:</B> You little piece
of...<BR><BR>(<I>Warlock glares at <B>him</B> next. Ram can't resist the
opportunity to gloat.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Norton:</B> I'd say that your people are
about finished by now. And <B>my</B> successor's far more ... healthy than yours
is at the moment. I'd say the Merritts are ahead on points. You took a great
many pawns ... but <B>I</B> took your pieces of some worth. Rooks, knights ...
and the Queen.<BR><BR>(<I>Warlock doesn't say a word; just grabs for his mobile
phone and hits a speed-dial number. There's a pause, then he gives an icy grin
in Ram's direction as he speaks.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Yeah, Peril. Just
checking in. (<I>beat</I>) Good. We're about clear here. Sitrep
later.<BR><BR>(<I>He hits 'End' and <B>looks</B> at Ram, who looks
shocked.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Norton:</B> That's ... impossible.<BR><BR>(<I>At which
point, Fett double-taps him. Ram falls over. Trent looks relieved and
triumphant; Nick the same, if a little sick. Warlock's face is
expressionless.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Trent:</B> All right! We
won!<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> No. We didn't.<BR><BR>(<I>He hits 'redial' on the
phone and holds it out to Trent. He, Nick and Fett listen as we hear what
Warlock heard.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>VO from phone; recording</I>) You
have reached Purple Peril's phone. If you're receiving this message ...
whoops.<BR><BR>(<I>Trent and Nick look at each other, then at Warlock, who still
betrays no emotion. Apart from the muffled sounds of the continuing gunfight
beyond Ram's office, there is utter silence.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Nick:</B> She said
that when...<BR><BR><B>Trent:</B> Shut up.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> This means
something?<BR><BR><B>Nick:</B> She said it when she thought she was gonna die.
(<I>beat; into the tense silence</I>) It was a false alarm
then!<BR><BR><B>Trent:</B> Totally different, man. What are the odds it's a
false alarm now? (<I>beat</I>) And who went down with
her?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Don't jump to conclusions yet. There's still hope
until we've seen the bodies.<BR><BR>(<I>Trent and Nick glare at him, then walk
away. Warlock scowls after them.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Is it just rock
band members that are so undisciplined?<BR><BR><B>Fett:</B> Hey, Herr Warlock,
chill the fuck out, wouldja? They're kids!<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> They're older
than you are, Fett. Now shut up and follow them. We're going to see just how bad
the situation is.<BR><BR>(<I>He stalks out after Nick and Trent. Fett scowls
after him.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: the Fortress of Cynicism, ext. Music: Cold -- "Send In the Clowns". Merritts in
scattered cover, most notably in the explosives-created trench in the front
yard. Occasionally one lets off a few rounds toward the house, answered
similarly. The scene screams "Mexican standoff". Pan up to a window; Jane and AP
are leaning out. Jane has a gun. AP's just watching for the time
being.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Jeez, don't these people give up
ever?<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> So long as we got rid of the ones <B>in</B> the house,
it's cool for now. (<I>beat</I>) And at least now I have a few tricks for the
squatters in the basement if they ever come back.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> You wouldn't
do that to innocent people, wouldja?<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Not the thing with the
TV, and not that little trick with the chandelier, cos we don't have one, and
probably not with your "it's a phaser", and Method 4 was
overkill...<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> In the words of a great man with bad hair, no, I
think that was just enough kill, seeing as how they were pointing big-ass guns
at us that were <B>probably</B> loaded with hollowpoints or at <B>least</B> had
crosses filed in 'em...<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Yeah, yeah, you made your point, but
for a bunch of squatters... oh jeez, here comes wave three...<BR><BR><B>AP:</B>
Hey, no, wait...<BR><BR>(<I>Back to their view out the window. Into the scene
come rolling the strike force's vehicles, bwv in the lead. The passenger side
window rolls down. Out pokes a bright red bullhorn. Which promptly blows "the
cavalry charge".</I>)<BR><BR><B>Random Merritt:</B> THIS I do not BELIEVE.
They're a Family of drama queens. <BR><BR>(<I>Said random Merritt takes aim and
shoots the bullhorn.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP &amp; Jane:</B> (<I>OS</I>) THANK
YOU!<BR><BR>(<I>Cut to inside bwv. Incubus behind the wheel, Warlock shotgun,
with the remains of the bullhorn in his hand; he looks at it ruefully and tosses
it.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> At least two of them are okay. (<I>behind
him</I>) Hand me the pump-action, wouldja?<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: ranch house
entry hall. Music: Linkin Park -- "In the End". Warlock and Fett enter first, weapons at the ready. But it's quiet.
The only sign that there was life here at one point is a young man who is
handcuffed to a radiator, smeared with face cream and painted all over with
green and orange. He's not moving.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Fett:</B> Any shots on
him?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> No shots ... no blood...<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B>
(<I>OS</I>) One of the Methods, guys.<BR><BR>(<I>Fett and Warlock look up.
Quinn's at the top of the stairs, looking down at
them.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> (<I>cont'd</I>) See, I didn't even <B>think</B>
about using that on Sandi, even to just make her <B>sick</B>, or whatever. But
Jane wanted to do something a little more artistic or something on one of them
when stuff got quiet and we had the stuff lying around
<B>anyway</B>...<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> ..."Stuff".<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Oh,
just some face cream with some other stuff mixed in ... <B>I</B> dunno --
cya-something.<BR><BR><B>Incubus:</B> (<I>from behind them</I>)
Cyanide?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> (<I>coming in from a corridor</I>) Potassium
cyanide. I think she and AP made it as a Christmas present for
DJ.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> (<I>from behind Quinn at the top of the stairs</I>)
Yeah, but we didn't want it just lying around, and anyway, that's supposed to be
one of the little bastards who shot Jesse.<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Where're the
Peril and the Maverick?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> I ... I don't know. I haven't seen
them. Jane? Quinn?<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Uh ... no...<BR><BR>(<I>AP dashes out of
a room upstairs, heads for the stairs, loses his balance at the top and is only
prevented from tumbling headlong down the things by Quinn and Jane grabbing his
arms.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> So we all here?<BR><BR>(<I>Enter Trent and Nick.
Trent heads straight for the stairs and his sister. When Jane lets go of his arm
to head down to meet Trent, AP rushes down them himself. Jane and Trent meet on
the stairs and hug <B>tight</B>.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Trent:</B> Thank God you're
okay. We got Lynn's message and we thought...<BR><BR>(<I>AP, now at the bottom
of the stairs, turns to Trent so fast he falls over.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> You
got her <B>voicemail</B>? Her phone was <B>OFF</B>?<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Who
was the last one to see her?<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> M...me. I ... I ...
I...<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>OS</I>) Were playing hand grenades with the poor
man's phaser, last I saw.<BR><BR>(<I>They <B>all</B> turn to see Lynn, coming
through a door at the back of the room. She's spattered with gore and she's
quite pale. For a moment, no one speaks.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> Any of that
yours?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Not enough to...<BR><BR><B>AP:</B>
<B>LYNN</B>!<BR><BR>(<I>He scrambles to his feet and launches himself across the
room at her, nearly knocking her over. After a bone-crushing hug, Lynn pulls
away slightly.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> I'm covered in...<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Oh,
who gives a...<BR><BR>(<I>They start kissing. It, much like the Energizer bunny,
just keeps going and going and going... Cut to Jane and Trent on the
stairs.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Getting ideas, brother dear?<BR><BR>(<I>Trent
slides down the banister, hits the floor and opens his arms to Daria, who
approaches him slowly. Too slowly for his liking -- he takes three running steps
to intercept her and grabs her up.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Well, it's about
<B>time</B>!<BR><BR>(<I>Meanwhile, Lynn and AP, who <B>still</B> haven't broken
the kiss, have stumbled towards and through an open door. A boot hits it and it
slams shut. Cut to Fett, Warlock and Incubus, who look slightly amused by the
whole thing.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> That was a
bedroom...<BR><BR><B>Incubus:</B> Lucky guy.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> (<I>breaking
her embrace with Trent</I>) I hope you don't think we're playing
follow-the-leader, Trent.<BR><BR>(<I>Trent just shrugs and kisses her some
more.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> My <B>god</B>, unpopular people <B>do</B> put
out!<BR><BR><B>Jane, Warlock, Fett, </B><B>Incubus:</B> Shut it,
Narcissa!<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> (<I>taken aback</I>) FINE! I'm going to take a
shower!<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> No hot water. Bad pipes and blown fuses in the
basement, remember?<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Ewwwwwwwwww!<BR><BR>(<I>Quinn runs away
from the stairway and we hear a door slam. Jane looks from the direction Quinn
took, to Trent and Daria, to the shut living room door, to Warlock, Trent and
Incubus, who shrug at her in a "now what?" manner.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> We
kept your heirs safe, we downed a <B>lot</B> of your rivals and we got you the
war.<BR><BR><B>Fett:</B> And your point?<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> You owe us pizza.
And <B>lots</B> of it.<BR><BR>(<I>Jane moves the rest of the way down the
stairs, brushes past them and exits.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Incubus:</B> She can eat.
I'm impressed.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> (<I>OS</I>) Come <B>on</B>! That kind of
workout would put an appetite on an anorexic! (<I>beat</I>) And do you
<B>reeeeeeeeeeally</B> want to be around when that bedroom gets ... <B>ahem</B>
noisy?<BR><BR>(<I>That gets through to even Daria and
Trent.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Trent:</B> A-Tank.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B>
Shotgun.<BR><BR>(<I>They exit. Warlock, Fett and Incubus
follow.</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Black screen. White writing reads "30 December,
2000". Fade up to...</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: private hospital room. Music: Ani DiFranco -- "To the Teeth". It's
looking a little lived-in -- books, a laptop computer, stacks of paper, flowers
and cards, varied hospital room detritus. Kes is sitting up in bed, a little
stiffly, reading. Enter Lynn, with Daria behind her like a trepidatious
shadow.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Jan.<BR><BR><B>Kes:</B> Hallo, you lot.
(<I>beat</I>) How're you coping?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> "Coping". That's a good
one.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> We have a few things to set straight with
you...<BR><BR><B>Kes:</B> No; <B>I</B> have a few things to set straight with
<B>you</B>, cousin mine. With <B>all</B> of you. And I'll start with Uncle
Jerome's will.<BR><BR>(<I>She pulls a few sheets of paper from the top of the
stack on the table before her, looks them over.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Kes:</B> Now,
Uncle Jerome made a few last-minute changes to his will after the summer ended.
Basically, it states that Smythe Affiliated belongs to his two daughters, to be
managed by myself until such time as they grow into the
position.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> <B>Oh</B> no. I'm not...<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Jan,
do you even...?<BR><BR><B>Kes:</B> (<I>holding up a hand for silence</I>)
<B>But</B>, if you'd let me finish... (<I>beat</I>) Daria, this is
yours.<BR><BR>(<I>She gropes for another piece of paper and hands it to Daria.
Daria scans it and her eyes go <B>big</B>.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> A bank
account. In my name. Containing a pro sports star's salary for most of his
career. Including endorsements.<BR><BR><B>Kes:</B> It's called "buying you out".
Your half of Smythe Affiliated belongs to me, if you accept this. And you're out
-- I've made some provisions regarding buying your privacy. Provided you take no
further part in any action against the Merritts, now or in the future, your
safety is assured. You're out ... Ms Morgendorffer.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> What
about Jane and AP? Quinn? Jodie and Mack? The band?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B>
<B>And</B> Lynn.<BR><BR><B>Kes:</B> Jane and AP won't be as well-off as Daria is
in all this, but Jerome left them both a little something; it's the closest
thing to an apology he could think to give, I suppose. And the provisions around
Daria cover them as well. That includes Quinn, your bandmates and Jodie and
Mack.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> From what I've been hearing, it's not that simple for
AP. What about Jensen's brother?<BR><BR><B>Kes:</B> We're ... <B>I'm</B> ... in
the process of making provisions for that, as well. You're going to have to
trust me there -- you <B>all</B> are.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> And what about
Lynn?<BR><BR><B>Kes:</B> Entirely up to her. I've bought her safety until she
finishes high school, renegotiable afterwards, depending on her choice in the
matter. Basically, all of Lawndale is a Merritt-free zone from now on. But the
terms of the will won't allow me to simply buy Lynn out until such time as she
turns 21 and makes a clear-cut choice either way. (<I>to Lynn</I>) If you don't
want in, you still receive profits from the Affiliation and can live your life
<B>exactly</B> the way you want to. If you <B>do</B> want in ... your spot is
waiting.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> But...<BR><BR><B>Kes:</B> Now you listen to me,
Lynn. You got hauled into this by some very poor circumstances and a few even
poorer judgement calls on the part of your father. By sheer bad luck, people you
care for got hauled in with you. I've never been happy with it -- you're only
eighteen, and should be allowed a normal life and the ability to make your own
choices. Now I've bent over bloody <B>backwards</B> to make sure you all have a
fighting chance to get your lives back to normal. The <B>least</B> you could do
is appreciate it a bit.<BR><BR>(<I>Silence in the
room.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Yeah. Um. Thanks. (<I>beat</I>) Really.
Thanks.<BR><BR><B>Kes:</B> (<I>small smile</I>) You're
welcome.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Now how am I going to explain this to my
parents?<BR><BR><B>Kes:</B> (<I>raised eyebrow</I>) Who says you have to? If
there's something you must buy with the cash in that account, tell them the
truth -- your biological father bestowed some guilt-cash on
you.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Can I talk to Jan alone for a minute,
Daria?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Sure. I'll be outside with the
others.<BR><BR>(<I>Daria exits. Lynn looks at Jan.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> What
happens to <B>you</B>?<BR><BR><B>Kes:</B> *shrug* None of your concern, for now.
But let's just say I have good people around. I'll be
fine.<BR><BR>(<I>beat</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> They're going to be
safe?<BR><BR><B>Kes:</B> As anyone ever is. (<I>beat</I>) Which way are you
leaning, if I may ask?<BR><BR>(<I>Long silence. Lynn bows her
head.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> I don't know.<BR><BR><B>Kes:</B> Fair enough. But
whatever you do, don't let the internal debate colour your <B>entire</B> life.
You have a good chance at something ... well, let's just say something
<B>more</B> with those three. Don't waste it because of this. You get very
lonely if you try.<BR><BR>(<I>Lynn looks hard at Kes, who looks back
stoically.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> I think you have a few things to tell me,
don't you?<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: Hospital canteen. Music plays on. Daria sits with Jane, AP and
Quinn.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> So. Happy now?<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Well,
<B>yeah</B>! But, like, are you going to use that money to get some decent
<B>clothes</B> or something? I mean, <B>God</B>, Daria, that outfit
<B>bites</B>! (<I>to the looks</I>) I'm <B>kidding</B>! Like I need the
competition <B>anyway</B>.<BR><BR>(<I>Daria gives Quinn a look of fond
exasperation. Jane's expression is much the same, though it holds less fondness
and more exasperation, and AP just rolls his eyes.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> I
once said that I didn't know what the future holds, and that the only thing I
<B>did</B> know was that if it moved, I was shooting it. (<I>beat</I>) I tempted
fate, didn't I?<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> But that part of it's over
now.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> For us, anyway. What about Lynn?<BR><BR><B>AP:</B>
She's not stupid. She'll figure <B>something</B> out. Anyway, for now, let's
play cricket!<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Since when did you get interested in British
sports?<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> You know what I mean! The cricket and ... ants, and
... the world owes me a living...<BR><BR><B>Jane, Daria &amp; Quinn:</B>
Grasshopper.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Oh. Anyway. We saved our butts. I say we
party!<BR><BR>(<I>They all look at him.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> <B>He</B>
watches <B>BUFFY</B>?<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> We don't let that get around.
(<I>perky-popular voice a la "The F Word"</I>) Like, we have our
<B>reputation</B> to think of, or whatever.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Hey, <B>you're</B>
the one who reads the fanfic! At least I don't sink <B>that</B>
low!<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Hey, I mostly read it because of the sick entertainment
value of Xander/Angel slash!<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> EWWWW!<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B>
(<I>to Daria</I>) I was right -- even when you guys do <B>normal</B> stuff,
you're weird.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> So you get to keep your sense of superiority.
And you're arguing with it?<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Y'know ... I hate to admit it,
but the geek has a point. We <B>should</B> party. Sometimes you, like,
<B>need</B> to blow off a bit of steam! Look at <B>those</B>
two!<BR><BR>(<I>Back to Jane and AP</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> It's all about
artistic <B>outlet</B>!<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> It's all about people wanting to play
<B>God</B> with some characters that someone <B>else</B> made up! <B>And</B>
doing it crappy!<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Actually, I'm not surprised you don't read
it -- that would involve understanding words of two syllables or
more!<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Hey! When you can figure out square roots of five-digit
numbers or higher in your head, <B>then</B> you can call me stupid! Until then,
<B>shut it</B>!<BR><BR>(<I>Back to Daria and Quinn, with the arguing carrying on
in the background.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> You make a point. But would you be
seen at a party with freaks?<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> It's not like anyone
<B>popular</B> is going to see me there!<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> (<I>Mona Lisa
smile</I>) Thanks, Quinn.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> What for?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B>
For staying you.<BR><BR>(<I>Exit Lynn. Daria stands to meet
her.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> You okay?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> As I'm going to be.
(<I>beat</I>) There's a wake-thing happening at that house tomorrow
night.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> (<I>raised eyebrow</I>) Oh yeah. The
scarred-woodwork and bloodstain motif just <B>makes</B> a
party.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Ask Jane about that -- her with the tribute to
Jackson Pollack. Anyway, it's mostly being cleaned up and at least we don't have
to worry about wrecking the place.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> There's one thing you
<B>are</B> forgetting.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Huh?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Drunken
crime family members.falling into the holes in the front lawn.<BR><BR>(<I>Lynn
looks at Daria, who gives a Mona Lisa smile. Lynn responds to it in kind. It's a
nice moment. Until...</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> (<I>OS</I>) I can't
<B>believe</B> you're being such an elitist!<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> (<I>OS</I>) I
can't believe <B>you</B> have no taste!<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B>
Buffyfic?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Isn't it always?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> That or
punk.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Party?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> We could use
it.<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Black screen. White writing reads "31 December 2000". Fade up
to...</I>)<BR><BR><BR>(<I>Scene: ranch house living room. Music: The Velvet
Underground -- "The Strangest Party" [soft; in the background]. It probably
<B>is</B> the strangest party, at least for Quinn; she stands on the sidelines
watching as the others sit in small knots, drinking, not saying much.
Eventually, she walks over to AP, who is sitting a little apart from Daria, Jane
and Lynn with a pizza box on his lap. Her facial expression indicates that she
doesn't believe she's resorting to talking to him.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B>
Hi...<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Hey ho.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Who're <B>these</B> freaks?
This is <B>such</B> an uncool song.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Classic Britstuff,
Narcissa. Course, <B>you</B> only know stuff from bands that some bunch of suits
made up, so you're kinda lost here. These people like
<B>original</B>.<BR><BR>(<I>Quinn scowls at him. AP doesn't notice. Then Quinn
looks at the pizza box.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Does that thing have
cheese?<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> This one, no.<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> Can I have a
piece?<BR><BR>(<I>AP gives her a very strange look.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B>
Ooooooookay.<BR><BR>(<I>He opens the box, hands her a slice, takes one for
himself and shuts the box again. Pan to Daria, Jane and Lynn, who have watched
this transaction with interest.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> I guess no one ever
warned her about the APizza.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> That is <B>not</B> the
APizza.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> The Techno-Weasel changes his feeding
habits?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> This is the thing he gets when he feels like having
something more...<BR><BR>(<I>Quinn's scream Dopplers into shot as she runs
past.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Quinn:</B> HothothothotHOTHOTHOT!<BR><BR>(<I>They all
follow her with their eyes, then stare at Lynn, whose face is
expressionless.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>as if she hadn't been
interrupted</I>) ...Intense.<BR><BR>(<I>Enter AP, looking a little
annoyed.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Jeez, everyone's a critic. She coulda at least
asked what was <B>on</B> it first...<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Let's say I'm asking
on her behalf.<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Red pesto base, onions, tofu chunks, asparagus,
jalapenos and wasabi. Oh, and...<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> Don't tell me, let me guess
-- extra garlic.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> And she <B>ate</B> that? (<I>beat</I>) And
<B>you</B> ate that?<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> And you expect Lynn to kiss you
<B>after</B> you've eaten that?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Part of his last birthday
present to me was a butt-load of mints, to be presented to him as and when
necessary.<BR><BR>(<I>Quinn returns, wiping her mouth with a damp washcloth and
carrying a piece of paper. She peels off the backing and slaps it onto the pizza
box without a word -- it is a Biohazard warning label sticker. Then she stalks
off. They watch her. Then they start laughing ... all but AP, who looks at it,
very much offended.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Hey, look, Narcissa, you <B>asked</B>
for it!<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> So what are we going to do with ourselves when we
get back to Lawndale?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> What, you mean now that we don't have
to pummel secrets out of Lynn and run for our lives every school break?
(<I>beat</I>) Study? Try to graduate?<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> (<I>for some reason
bitter</I>) College interviews.<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Get back to the writing.
(<I>beat</I>) I have a whole new perspective on Melody Powers now, I
guess.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> I was thinking of a new series of paintings. "The End
of Innocence" or something like that.<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Well, without the band
I'll have plenty of time to model for <B>that</B>.<BR><BR>(<I>Slight respectful
pause. AP breaks it with a hopeful look.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> Prom? (<I>beat;
to the looks</I>) Oh, c'mon, we <B>gotta</B> do Prom! I mean, I know the music's
gonna suck and the people're gonna look at us funny and I'm gonna have to do the
tux rental thing and it'll mean shopping again and all that, but ... but ...
but...<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> But you're an incurable romantic who's afraid to
admit it lest his girlfriend make a spirited attempt to disembowel him for being
a soppy twerp?<BR><BR>(<I>AP blushes magenta. Lynn rolls her eyes, and lets the
pause stretch out and become loaded before...</I>)<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> Yeah, we
have to do Prom. (<I>beat</I>) But no corsages!<BR><BR><B>AP:</B> (<I>blushing
with pleasure now</I>) Aye-aye, ma'am!<BR><BR><B>Warlock:</B> (<I>OS</I>)
Peril.<BR><BR>(<I>They all look at Lynn, who shrugs and stands
up.</I>)<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> Lynn, no...<BR><BR><B>Lynn:</B> I don't think it's
like that. If it turns out to be...<BR><BR>(<I>She considers, then just shrugs
again and walks off. They watch as she approaches Warlock, who's sitting by a
large unlit fireplace with Leopard and Kes. Leopard holds an acoustic guitar.
Back to Daria, Jane and AP, who look a little perplexed.</I>)<BR><BR><B>AP:</B>
Guess it really <B>isn't</B> like that.<BR><BR><B>Jane:</B> I dunno. You think
it's good to see her tight with them?<BR><BR><B>Daria:</B> I couldn't tell you.
(<I>beat</I>) But in a way, they <B>are</B> her family. Like it ... or
not.<BR><BR>(<I>The tone her last two words take indicate that it's most
definitely "not", but that there's nothing she can do about it. And the music

parked by the side of the road. Pan back to see a sign: "WELCOME TO LAWNDALE:
POPULATION 1,437". That number is scrawled out, probably by one of Jane's
graffiti pens, and underneath it is written "1,434". Hold on that for a moment

<CENTER>END</CENTER></FONT></B><BR><BR><BR><B>ENDNOTES</B><BR><BR>It's been over
a year since I wrote the last TLAS installment, so I guess the first thing to
say is "sorry to keep you waiting". Mitigating circumstances, and all that.
Anyway, it's here now. Hope it was worth the wait.<BR><BR>Thanks go out to three
people. First, to Ben Yee -- the erstwhile co-author, the best friend, and the
one I could call on 17th August 2001. If TLAS goes completely to pot after this
one, or if no one liked <B>this</B> one, all I'll be able to say is that it's
just not the same without him, and never will be. Then to Austin Loomis; who
made the other important call of that night and always reminds me what I have
without even knowing it, as well as at least trying to keep up with my pace in
tandem writing. And then to Caira (<I>rancour, whatever</I>), for doing live-in
beta reader duty for the week -- I'm just hoping the clubbing, museums and food
is payment enough for the opinions. Not to mention the immense help he was with the music at the end of it -- he was so utterly patient with me when I got stuck on something, and his suggestions rocked.<BR><BR>So is this the end of TLAS? God, no.
Will this be the end of the Mafia involvement? I hope so, but you never know
when the slippery little buggers are going to show up again. All I know is that
Brother Grimace has a point -- these kids need to be kids. I put them through
hell, and now they deserve a little fun, the way only that group knows how. I
have a few tricks of the TLAS-S1 variety still up my sleeve, so watch this
space.<BR><BR><BR><B>OBLIGATORY LEGAL
