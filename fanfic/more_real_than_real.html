<p class=MsoPlainText>Synopsis:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not long
after the Morgendorffer's arrive, a new student comes to Lawndale.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She's more than she seems to be.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Backstory:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jalura
is a character I developed for playing the Amber Diceless Role Playing Game,
some ten years ago.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The name is even
older, a tribe name from the game Ysgarth -- I didn't play the game, but
someone who did borrowed it for a character name in an AD&amp;D campaign, and I
played the character.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The personality
evolved from the AD&amp;D character.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In
the Amber game universe, Jalura is the daughter of Caine and heir to the throne
of Gaiga, one of the Golden Circle kingdoms.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>She has walked the Pattern, and is a sorceress, shape shifter, and Trump
artist.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the Amber game universe, she
is quite formidable; although this story is set a fair bit earlier in her
'life.'<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Any versions of the Chronicles
mentioned in this story or references to Amber may be different in ways subtle
and substantive, at this author's discretion and plot needs, from those
available in the bookstores of our world.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>***<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Prologue:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>An
apartment near Stanford, CA, April 28, local calendar.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>A young woman, maybe sixteen years old, is sitting on a
couch watching television.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If she were
standing, she'd be about 5'8&quot;.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>An
attractive long oval face, with perhaps a touch of olive in her complexion,
blue eyes and an aquiline nose.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She is
slender, but with an athletic build.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She
has straight brown hair with red highlights, past shoulder length and held back
with a clip whose design is the shape of a Penrose Dart.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She is wearing a blue blouse with silver
highlights and matching grey slacks, accented by black leather boots and hip
pouch that somehow go with the other clothes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Definitely not a typical teenager, despite being parked in front of a
television.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The front door opens, and a tall, handsome, college-aged
man enters.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Seeing the teenager sitting
on his couch and idly watching MTV, he frowns.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;J, we need to talk.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The girl looks up, sees his face and recognizes the
solemnity.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;About what?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;You have to leave, tomorrow.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Why?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Because you have enough problems already.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You don't need to get messed up in
mine.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Elaborate?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Friday is the 30th.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;So, you don't do anything special to celebrate
Walpurgisnacht.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;True, I do not.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But someone around here does.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Said person's preferred party game is to try to kill me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Family?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I assume so.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I just don't know which side.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Or
why.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Oh.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>She frowns.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Damn, Martin
will be out of contact for at least another week.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The only other relative I can trust.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I know.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But
I can't have you here being an extra target.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I don't know where to go.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I know.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That's how you and I met in the first place, remember.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yeah, and how Martin found me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Our family isn't easy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Especially when people want you dead just for
being in it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No, the 'especially' is when said people are also
in that family.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yeah.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Long pause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Why don't I fix
some dinner and we can go through my 'travel kit' afterward?&quot; as he heads
into the kitchen.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>From the couch, an unenthusiastic, &quot;Okay, Merle, if
you think it will help.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>From the television, &quot;...la-la LA la
la...&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Twenty-eight minutes of
'College Bored' later, a Mona Lisa smile appears on Jalura's face and a
decision is made.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Part One:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Day 1 at
Lawndale High School<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ms. Li's
office.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The principal, Ms. Li, puts down a manila folder and
faces her newest student.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Of
course, even with a transcript like yours, we can't waive any of the
formalities.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;That person was a complete waste of my time.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She knows nothing about psychology or
psychiatry.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Ms. Li visibly fumes at this, and starts to reach into
her suit's blazer for her tape recorder to make a note to herself about this,
but the new student notices the motion.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>In an ice cold voice, &quot;Whatever you are about to
reach for had better not be a weapon.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Ms. Li's hand freezes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The two stare at each other for almost thirty seconds.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is Ms. Li who flinches, for one of the few
times in her life actually intimidated by someone.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Ms. Li's gaze focuses on the jacket being worn by the new
student.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A black leather jacket with the
word &quot;Hellriders&quot; in small red letters in an arc on the left sleeve.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I don't tolerate gang activity at
&lt;reverent&gt;Lawndale High&lt;/reverent&gt;, and have full authority to
--&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;This isn't a gang jacket.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is the jacket for my cousin's band.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I'm an honorary roadie.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Ms. Li is still trying to regain the upper hand in the
conversation.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;It looks like a gang jacket, and as I --&quot; but
she is again cut short.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Ms. Li.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In
my family, trust and respect and affection are rare and precious
commodities.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My cousin Martin has all
three from me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He plays saxophone in a
band, two actually.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He is a good man,
who has endured more pain and hurt and hate from our family than most people in
this town have ever had to face.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Despite
that, when I needed a refuge from that same family to which we reluctantly
acknowledge our membership, he unhesitatingly provided that refuge.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Do not judge what you do not know.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The new student rises, and heads toward the
door.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Now, if you'll excuse me, I
believe I have to find Mr. DiMartino's freshman American History class.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You wouldn't want me to be late for my first
class at &lt;mock reverent&gt;Lawndale High.&lt;/mock reverent&gt;&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And leaves.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Ms. Li finally manages to write a note for the file,
consisting of one word:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;Trouble.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mr.
DiMartino's classroom.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The bell rings, and the class slowly quiets, except for
four girls near the back.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Lawndale
High School Fashion Club appears to be having an emergency meeting on the
subject of nail polish coordination.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Gee, Quinn, that is such a good idea.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sandi Griffin's voice is resonant, and Mr.
DiMartino hears it quite clearly.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I'm CERTAIN that it is, Ms. Griffin, but unless YOU
want detention, you should try learning SOMETHING from the teacher.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That is what I get PAID for; if you call the
PITTANCE Ms. Li pays me a SALARY....<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Class, we have a new STUDENT joining us today. Please welcome Jalura
Duquesne.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jalura, raise your hand,
please.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura raises her hand.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Her jacket has apparently been deposited in her locker as it is not with
her.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;WELL, Jalura!&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>As long as you have your hand raised ... (chuckles evilly).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Last week we began a unit on the causes of
the American Revolution.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Perhaps you
feel it's UNFAIR to be asked a question on your first day of class.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura's frown deepens.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;I'm getting used to Lawndale.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Mr. DiMartino pauses for a moment at that response.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Well, um.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jalura, please concisely and unemotionally
sum up the doctrine of 'no taxation without representation.'&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura sighs, and then begins, “'No taxation without
representation' was a slogan popular in the late 1760s and through the
revolutionary period among the thirteen 'American' colonies, particularly those
in New England.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was used by people
who were upset at the lack of direct representation in the British Parliament
following a series of tax acts that raised the average colonist's taxes from
approximately 4% to 7.5% while raising the average British Isles subject's tax
from 7% to 13%.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These tax increases were
used to pay for the British expenses, mostly in the form of loans, incurred in
the Seven Years' War, called the French and Indian War -- the war in which much
of the so-called Northwest Territories transferred 'possession' from the French
to the British -- in the colonies where the slogan was popular.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The complaint of the colonists was in regard
to a lack of designated seats in Parliament.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The slogan was also a rejection of Sir Edmund Burke's argument that the
colonists had 'virtual representation' in Parliament.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The same slogan was used, with lesser effect,
after American independence, during Shays' Rebellion and the Whiskey
Rebellion.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These discussions of tax equity
did not include women.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It also
occasionally is used in current debates on tax 'rollback' referenda, although
such use misses the point of representation -- direct, virtual or
otherwise.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Mr. DiMartino is slow to respond.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Very good, Jalura.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Almost ... dangerously good.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Since you've also answered about FOUR other
questions I had PLANNED to ask today, I suppose I'll have to forsake the quiz I
WAS going to give at the end of the class.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Numerous appreciative sounds are made from the class.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Mr. DiMartino continues, &quot;So, INSTEAD, everyone will
have to write a four page paper on the causes of the Revolutionary War, due
tomorrow.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The appreciative sounds turn hostile.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>An anonymous voice from the back of the room
taunts, &quot;Way to go, brain.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura's frown deepens even further.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
Lawndale High School cafeteria.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;But, Sandi, you heard that answer she gave.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She's a brain!&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Gee, Quinn, maybe you only heard her answer to some
stupid question.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>_I_ saw the silk blouse
she was wearing and the hand-tooled Italian boots she was wearing.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And I think her hip pouch is genuine Prada.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Good eye, Stacy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I _was_ going to mention that.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Stacy Rowe cringes at the
criticism-disguised-as-a-compliment, but knows in her mind that Sandi Griffin
had not noticed the purse at all, despite being worn on Jalura's belt instead
of carried on the shoulder.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Stacy also
knows the real reason Quinn doesn't want this new girl in the Fashion Club; if
the new girl is a brain, she'll probably become friends with Daria
Morgendorffer, and Quinn will have to finally admit she's been lying for weeks
about the biological relationship between Quinn and her 'cousin.'<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Stacy gives 2/3 that Sandi knows the truth
and is waiting for an opportunity to use it to undermine Quinn's position in
the Fashion Club, and 99/100 that Quinn realizes that.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The fourth member of the Fashion Club, Tiffany
Blum-Deckler, speaks up, &quot;If she has clothes like that ... she probably
has a lot of money.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe ... she could
be ... treasurer.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Sandi smiles, knowing that she can count on Tiffany's
support ... whenever Sandi is around.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;That is just what I was thinking, Tiffany.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now, let us put it to a formal vote.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All in favor of offering membership in the
Fashion Club to Jalura Duquesne, raise your hands.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Three hands are quickly raised, and Quinn's
more slowly joins the others.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;That
is settled.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We shall speak with her at
the end of the school day.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ms.
Morris' gym class.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Volleyball.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria Morgendorffer and Jalura stand next to each
other.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Of other characters yet
introduced, only Stacy Rowe is present, and on the opposite team.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Ms. Morris throws a volleyball at Jalura, hard.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Alright, Duquesne, let's see if you can
serve.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura easily catches the ball with one hand, much to Ms.
Morris' annoyance, and replies, in Daria's general direction, &quot;Service with
a smile.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura turns, faces the other team, and steps behind the
base line.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She tosses the ball about one
foot above her head and punches the ball with her left hand as it falls.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The ball collects a wicked sidespin from the
punch and cleanly passes in a left-curving arc between the opposing lines and
hits the court for a point.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Stacy chases
the ball down and rolls it back to Jalura for the next service.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This process is repeated, with variations
only in where the ball lands and thus who has to chase the ball, for the rest
of the period.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>After changing back into street clothes at the end of
class, Jalura finally gets to speak to Daria as they are walking back to the
main (not gym) lockers at the end of the day, &quot;Sorry about hogging all the
glory, I'm sure you're a killer defense player.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Neither notices Stacy following at a semi-discreet
distance.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria notices the smile on Jalura's face, and despite
some surprise at actually being spoken to by someone, can't resist the
invitation, &quot;Sorry, I'm a pacifist.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Besides, that volleyball never did anything to hurt me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Volleyballs don't hurt people, people hurt
people?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>By the way, my name is Jalura
Duquesne.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Daria Morgendorffer.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Yeah, something like that, especially when
Ms. Morris is the one throwing the volleyball at your head with intent.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Ummm, yeah.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Let me ask you a question about this place.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Okay.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Is it just me, or are the teachers here ... lacking
in the teaching spirit?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;That depends.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Who do you have for your classes?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;That part of my day started with Mr. DiMartino, who
had me raise my hand when he introduced me, then asked me a question since my
hand was raised.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes, he pulled that trick on me on my first day of
class seven weeks ago.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then he accused
me of showing off when I raised my hand again to avoid extra homework.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Hrmph, I should have been so lucky.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I inadvertently answered several of the
questions he was going to ask in a quiz, so everyone has to write a four-page
paper.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I'm gonna be Miss Popularity
around here.&quot; <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>A Mona Lisa smile
crosses both of their faces, as a frown develops on the face of the
eavesdropping Stacy Rowe.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This means
that Stacy doesn't notice Jane Lane coming out of a restroom behind Stacy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jane, curious as to whom Daria is talking,
and why Stacy is following the two, gets in step two paces behind Stacy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jalura continues, &quot;Then Ms. Barch, who
doesn't realize that her misandristic behavior --&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Wait, did you just say 'misandristic?'&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yeah, as in the opposite of --&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I know what it means; I'm just amazed to have heard
it spoken by anyone in this building, or this state.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Please continue.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Both Stacy and Jane hear the word, but
neither knows what it means.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Okay, so Ms. Barch is just perpetuating the cycle
of gender bias by teaching a new generation of men to fear and hate women and
said men will grow up to mistreat women who will, in turn, become like Ms.
Barch and ....&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Interesting hypothesis.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Next on 'America's Top Forty?'&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura catches the reference and returns it easily,
&quot;More like 'America's Most Wanted.'<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Anyway, I then had an hour of Mr. O'Neill projecting his opinions and
emotional responses onto a room full of kids who don't know any better rather
than acknowledge the thoughts as his own, followed by Bennett's economics class
that featured a chart more convoluted than my family tree.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria makes a mental note about the reference to a
convoluted family tree, but decides to say nothing until Jalura brings up the
subject by itself.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Yeah, that's
those two, boiled down to their essences.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Don't tempt me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Actually, I'll reserve that honor for the
&lt;sarcasm&gt;honored&lt;/sarcasm&gt; principal of &lt;mock
reverent&gt;Lawndale High.&lt;/mock reverent&gt;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And that pop psychobabbler Manson.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Ah, yes, Principal Li.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If she weren't Korean, she'd be a Nazi.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Oh, I think that Ms. Li would fit in well in Kim Il
Sung's 'worker's paradise'.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But, after
lunch I did have art class with Ms. Defoe.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The class is pretty pedestrian, and she still seems to care, but I
figure about another ten years and she'll be as borderline psychotic as Mr.
DiMartino.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No, I think she'll quit for the sake of her sanity
before that happens.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I hope so.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>And as for Math class --&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Just at that moment, the rest of the Fashion Club comes
around a corner and right in the path of the parade.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sandi notices Stacy and says, &quot;There you
are, Stacy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We've been looking for you
so that we could talk to Jalura here.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>At Sandi's comment, Daria and Jalura stop and look behind
them to see Stacy and Jane.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Eyebrows
rise on Daria's and Jalura's faces, while Stacy tries to become invisible.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura smirks, and thinks to herself, &quot;I could teach
you how REALLY to become invisible, girl&quot; but says, &quot;Hail, hail, the
gang's all here.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What can I do for you,
...?”<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I am Sandi Griffin, President of the Lawndale High
School Fashion Club, and ...&quot; Sandi notices Daria and Jane.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Ummm, Quinn's cousin, or whatever, this
is a meeting of the Fashion Club and is reserved for members and guests.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria's annoyance carries into her voice, but only Jane,
Quinn, and Jalura hear it as Daria says, &quot;Oh by all means, I wouldn't wish
to interrupt the sanctity of the Fashion Club, but as it is meeting at my
locker, I believe I have a prior reservation for this meeting
facility.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And with that, Daria
opens her locker and begins to gather her things for the walk to Jane's house
that follows most days.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura puts Daria's annoyance into a more overt
form.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Oh, yes.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sandi Griffin, the fool who doesn't know when
to shut up at the start of a class.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I'm
sure that your nail polish matches whatever it was it was supposed to go
with.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What _do_ you want?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hopefully you weren't going to offer me a
membership in your worthless little clique of trite trend worshippers who
wouldn't know fashion if it stepped up and beheaded you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Everyone in that little circle is surprised, Daria and
Jane pleasantly so.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sandi, Stacy and
Tiffany are shocked and just a smidgeon frightened, and Quinn is unsure whether
to feel good that Sandi is being taken down a peg in public, disappointed that
Quinn wasn't the one to do it, or dismay that Jalura is obviously getting along
with Daria.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Several seconds pass before Sandi manages, &quot;Uh, um,
ah, urp.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And walks away with the
Fashion Club in tow.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As they depart,
both Quinn and Stacy think to themselves, &quot;Wow.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Tiffany, however, doesn't quite realize what has
happened, and asks, &quot;But Sandi, aren't we ... going to make her ... the
treasurer?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Shut up, Tiffany!&quot; and they round the corner.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jane steps up and says, &quot;Well, I'm damned
impressed.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura smiles and cocks an eyebrow, and it is fully
loaded, &quot;Well, Damned, pleased to meet you. I'm Jalura Duquesne.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jane pauses, hearing the commas in Jalura's remark, but
sees the smile, and returns it sheepishly.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria's face almost makes it to a full smile, almost.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Actually, this is my friend Jane
Lane.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Hello, Jane.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I still go by Jalura, but I understand keeping an alias or two
handy.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria adds another note to herself for future
consideration, but still makes conscious a decision that she realizes she had
already made.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She has another
friend.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Hey, what say we continue
this at the Pizza King?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura's eyebrow is still cocked and loaded, &quot;Sure,
I got tired watching that dazzling display of athletic prowess you put on
today.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jane misses the ironic reference, having not been in gym
class with them, but nonetheless enters the banter, &quot;Oh, yeah, well, you
should see her fencing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Her blade is
even sharper than her tongue.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura's tone changes to one of genuine enthusiasm,
&quot;Really?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hey, that's great, someone
to practice with.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What is your blade
preference, and which techniques do you like?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria makes a third mental note, while Jane pipes in,
&quot;Just kidding, she doesn't really mess with swords.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>For the first time, Jalura realizes she's said a bit more
than necessary.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sounding a great deal
like Stacy after one of Sandi's faux compliments, Jalura says simply,
&quot;Oh.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Pizza
King.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The Three Musketresses are sharing a pizza and discussing
Lawndale High.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Somewhere along the way,
Jalura has reclaimed her jacket from her locker.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yeah, Ms. Morris hates me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thinks my whole family is nothing but a bunch
of slackers.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura shakes her head, &quot;Well, Jane, just because
you don't define yourself by her terms is no reason for her to think ill of you.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You are an artist; you do what matters to
you.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She should respect that.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I do.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria is about to agree when she notices a slightly-built
male walking toward them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Upchuck
alert.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jane grimaces, and Jalura looks at Daria, thinking the
latter was responding to the compliment.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Hello, lovely ladies.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And who is this divine creature?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A new sylph to grace the halls of Lawndale
High?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Allow me to introduce myself,
Charles Ruttheimer, the Third.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura's look of disgust is plainly visible to all but Upchuck.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jalura looks at Daria and Jane and says,
&quot;So much for the third time being the charm.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Rrrrrrr, feisty.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Upchuck attempts to enter the booth but
Jalura's hand pushes him backward.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Upchuck sails back a good two meters before his feet retouch the ground,
whereupon the sudden shift in his moment of inertia induces a rather graceless
fall and butt-slide that causes him to wind up sitting on the floor in front of
a highly amused Andrea.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She gets up from
her chair near the window, pours her soft drink on Upchuck's head, throws some
cash on the table and leaves, giving Jalura a thumbs-up on the way out the
door.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Upchuck half-crawls to the
restroom.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria thinks to herself, &quot;If I wind up with too many
more of these mental notes, I'm going to have to put a cork board in my
head.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But what comes out of her
mouth is a simple, &quot;Wow.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The commotion gathers the attention of Kevin Thompson,
quarterback of the Lawndale High Lions football team, who -- like the immortal
Brian Dowling or more like his Doonesbury-esque incarnation -- wears a uniform
at almost all times so that people will know that Kevin is the
quarterback.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It also gathers the
attention of Brittany Taylor, cheerleader and Kevin's girlfriend even if she is
no Barbara Ann Boopstein, Michael Jordan MacKenzie, the captain of the football
team but without uniform at this time, and Jodie Landon -- and this story is
already long enough without putting her curriculum vitae into it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The four approach.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Wow, that was some pretty impressive blocking, huh,
Mack Daddy?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Don't call me that!&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura looks to Daria for introductions.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Of course, from the one episode of the show
she saw in Merlin's apartment, Jalura already knows these four, and is glad for
the familiarity following a day of unpleasant surprises about this world.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria, however, doesn't see the look from Jalura as the
former is still staring at Upchuck's landing spot.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Yeah, it was pretty
impressive.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Turning fully to face
Jalura, Daria asks, &quot;How did you do that?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura, again aware that she's a bit too open, demurs,
&quot;Martial arts training.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Moments of
inertia and such.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria clearly is suspicious, but before she can even
pretend to accept the answer, Kevin again chimes in, &quot;Hey, could you teach
that to our offensive line?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They could
push the other team right out of the way and we'd win all our games, right Mack
Daddy?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Michael knows that he's just going to have to tolerate
Kevin for the rest of the conversation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;I think the technique is illegal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Unsportsmanlike conduct.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Kevin frowns.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;Oh.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That's too bad.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Michael faces Jalura, &quot;Hi, I'm Michael MacKenzie,
and&quot; just because he has to tolerate, does not mean he must do so without
comment &quot;I don't like being called 'Mack Daddy.'&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura smiles.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;So I heard, Michael.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Besides, MickMack would be a much more fitting nickname.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I am Jalura Duquesne.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>She extends her hand, and Michael shakes it somewhat
tentatively, while pondering her idea.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jodie looks oddly at the gesture and Michael's
reaction.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;I'm Jodie Landon, Mike's
girlfriend.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura looks at Jodie with intent.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Jodie, aren't you more than just
that?&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then smiles.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jodie's discomfort shifts from one of budding jealousy to
one of something else as she tries to match Jalura's gaze and fails.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I'm Kevin Thompson, I'm the QB.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Brittany elbows Kevin in the side, at which
he adds, &quot;And this is my girlfriend, Brittany.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura winks at Jodie, who realizes Kevin's inadvertent
play into Jalura's word game and finally smiles at Jalura.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura turns to Kevin and Brittany and sees their
respective uniforms.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;I see
that.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is there a game this
afternoon?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No, games are Friday nights.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Then why are you wearing a uniform today?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Michael isn't wearing a uniform.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria's mental note board gets another page, but it is
immediately taken back off as she realizes that Kevin had referenced the
football team to Michael in the first person plural possessive, not that Kevin
would have any understanding of grammar.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Kevin is undaunted.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;I'm the QB so I've got to maintain an image for the team.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Hmmm.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Jalura looks at Kevin.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;And
what image is that?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That your little
football is the only thing that matters in your life?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Kevin, obviously pleased that Jalura 'understands,'
replies, &quot;Of course, what else is t--.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Brittany, feeling taken for granted at
Kevin's words, stomps on his cleated foot and storms off.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Ow!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>What was that for, babe?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Babe?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hey, wait up!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>What?&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Kevin follows her out
the door, leaving the others shaking their heads and chuckling.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jodie is the first to recover.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;I heard what happened in the hall this
afternoon.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Fashion Club has a lot of
sway in popularity here.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You might not
have wanted to offend Sandi.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura laughs heartily.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;I don't need to be popular.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Gestures to the four others.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;I've made friends here.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria looks uncomfortable, and both Jalura and Jane
notice.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jane tries to cover for Daria
with a mocking, &quot;Now don't go trying to use any of that logic stuff to get
out of this trouble, young lady.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Being
popular is all-important.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura asks, &quot;Then why do Stacy and Quinn hang out
with such an obvious loser like Sandi?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>No one has an answer to that one, although Daria thinks
to herself, &quot;As far as those two are concerned, Jane is right.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To them, being popular _is_
all-important.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jane looks up at the wall clock.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Oh, shoot.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I've got to go meet Trent at the
Zen.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Looks at Daria with a smirk,
&quot;Do you want to come with?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I've got
to get home.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That lasagna isn't getting
any less pre-packaged and I'm probably going to have to do some spin control on
this afternoon.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Michael and Jodie take the cue that things are breaking
up, and Michael says, &quot;Yeah, we've got to get going, too.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was nice meeting you, Jalura.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I'll see you around.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jodie again looks uncomfortable, but says, &quot;Yeah. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Bye, everyone.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jane, and Mike and Jodie leave.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria and Jalura head out and appear to be heading in the
same direction.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A street
near Daria's house.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The two are walking in silence, each wrapped in their
thoughts about the day.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Finally, Jalura breaks the silence.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;So, are you going to ask, or just
continue to speculate?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Startled, Daria stops.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura, having taken an extra step before realizing that
Daria had stopped, turns to face Daria.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Jalura's look is expectant; Daria has to struggle to maintain her stoic
mask.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>After about ten seconds, Daria's expression shifts to one
of determination.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Alright.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You offered, so I'll ask.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Convoluted family tree?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Two:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Aliases?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Three:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Swords?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Four:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You were sitting, how did you get enough leverage to shove Upchuck
further than Mike could have with a running block?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Five:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Why do you seem to be able to read every person you encounter down to
their essence, like you did to Jodie, as if you could see straight into their
soul?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Six:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Given five, how do keep your sanity while
staring into the void?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura smiles at the last question.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Mene, mene tekel, ujalura?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I am but a pale Shadow, dwelling in Shadow
among Shadows.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria's look intensifies, something impressive to behold,
and lesser people would be frightened by it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;And you make even more obscurantist references than I do, and
catch all of mine.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura gives Daria a half-smile, and starts nodding.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;You're good.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But tell me this.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Have you become so accustomed to having your
emotional needs unfulfilled by your family that you not only have to shield
yourself against disappointment by unsuccessfully trying to not have emotional
needs but also by rejecting the people around you who would fill that void if
you'd let them?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria's demeanor changes completely.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She now looks as if she's about to pass
out.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Her determination broken, she is
now a very vulnerable teenage girl.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;Get out of my soul ... please.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No can do, girl.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You chose to consider me as a friend, and I accept that responsibility.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Um, I have to go.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Those who've seen the episode, 'Dye!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Dye!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>My Darling' will have a sense of deja vu at the words, and the tone of
voice in which they are said.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Daria runs
the block to her home.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jalura shakes her
head as she watches Daria go.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A grey
house not far from the Morgendorffer's.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Chez Duquesne.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Interior.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>A middle-aged man, who bears a striking resemblance to
one Vincent Lane, is speaking to Jalura.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;A Dr. Manson called.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She expressed concern that you have 'low
self-esteem' and suggested you take a class.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I laughed at her and told her you had no need of such, but that she
would probably benefit from some professional training.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;You did exactly right, Trinsch.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thank you.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You'll probably have to speak to the principal, Ms. Li, soon.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;You're welcome.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I see.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The 'embassy speech?'<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So, how is this Lawndale?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes, please.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>A long pause, then, &quot;So many details that I left uncovered.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Shall we adjust to a Shadow more what you had in
mind?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura thinks about this, but shakes her head.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;No.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If I learned anything from Martin, it is that you don't run from your
mistakes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You face them, and you do your
best to fix them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is the assassins
from whom you run, until you find a place from which to eliminate them.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And is this a spot from which to eliminate those
who seek your death?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is
a place through which I'm running until I can reach Martin.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I see.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And
are the locals expendable?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Not unless is comes to them-or-me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I won't knowingly use them as shields.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Very good, Your Grace.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
Morgendorffer's house.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The dinner table.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And she totally humiliated Sandi in front of the
rest of us.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria, still shaken by her last conversation with Jalura,
says, &quot;Um, Quinn.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Her insult
actually was directed at all of you, though I agree that she seems to have a
special dislike for Sandi.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen notices Daria's lack of barb.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Honey, what do you think of this new
girl?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen's attempt at being super-mom finally snaps Daria
back into stoic defense mode.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;I
think she'll go insane slowly like the rest of us in the asylum.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen hears the edge return to Daria's voice.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;You know, it wasn't all that long ago
that you were new here.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe we should
invite her and her family over for dinner to help make her feel welcome in
Lawndale.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Hey, honey, that's a great idea!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I can try out that new pesto recipe.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen looks at Jake as if about to erupt, but realizes
that he has backed up Helen and she relents.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;Jake, as much as we all love your cooking experiments, wouldn't it
be better to stick with something tried-and-true for their first meeting with
us?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;But, Helen, I ...&quot; seeing her look, Jake
deflates.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Sure, honey.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen, now looking triumphant, says, &quot;Well, that's
settled.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How about Thursday night?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Muh-omm.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
just told you.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She embarrassed
Sandi.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We _can't_ have her over, or I'll
get thrown out of the Fashion Club!&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria's barb feels a need to atone for a moment of as
close to sisterly as she normally gets with Quinn, and has a heavy feeling in
the pit of her stomach that 'normal' isn't going to apply much anymore.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;And how would that be a bad
thing?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Before Quinn can utter a reply, Helen intercedes.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Yes, Quinn, how would that be a bad
thing?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Despite your protestations of
friendship, you and Sandi get along even less well than her mother and I
do.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Muh-omm!&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria, deciding to take advantage of Helen's surprising
honesty, asks, &quot;And just why do you and Linda Griffin get along so
poorly?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen again is about to erupt, but Jake, knowing _this_
topic all too well and not wanting to spend the night on the couch, and knowing
that Eric from Helen's law firm would pick this one night not to call Helen
during dinner, jumps in.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;That's
none of your business, kiddo.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Finish
your dinner, and then go call your friend and invite her over for Thursday
dinner.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Everyone at the table is shocked at Jake's decisive
handling of the argument.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Helen visibly
deflates.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria, sounding more unenthusiastic than her normal,
replies, &quot;Ummm.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I don't know her
phone number.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I'll have to do it
tomorrow in school.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Part 2:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Next
Day<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ms. Li's
office.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Miss Duquesne.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I am very troubled by the reports I'm hearing about your behavior.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Insulting a member of the faculty in my
office yesterday was bad enough, but Ms. Morris said you were very aggressive
in Phys. Ed. class.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And don't think I
didn't hear about the incident with Mr. Ruttheimer at the restaurant.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Ms. Li.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
warned you yesterday not to judge what you do not understand.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You dislike me because I do not view you as
having authority over me and make no secret of that to you.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Your petty control issues are no concern of
mine unless they interfere with me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Do
not cross me again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As for Charles
Manson's twin sister, she is in far greater need of self-esteem help than
I.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The other Charles sexually harassed
Daria Morgendorffer, Jane Lane and I, and was gently chastised for it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ms. Morris threw a volleyball at me, as Daria
put it, with intent.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Be grateful that I
do not file charges for that.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Do not
waste more of my time.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Rises.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;I have to go put up with Mr.
DiMartino's outbursts for a while.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Jalura switches to Korean and says, &quot;Little earthworm, despite your
dreams, you are no dragon,&quot; as she exits.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>She doesn't notice Ms. Li blanch at the words in her
parents' tongue.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When she finally
recovers, she opens Jalura's file, which has been sitting on Ms. Li's desk, and
inserts the word &quot;Royal&quot; before the 'Trouble' that is already there.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ms.
Defoe's art class.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura finishes the required sketch of a still life set
in minutes and is working on a smallish, but well-detailed drawing of Daria on
a sheet of heavy parchment as Ms. Defoe comes up behind her.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Ms. Defoe sees the still-life and is about to offer the
usual bland praise when she notices the work in progress.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Jalura, that is exquisite.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You seem to be drawing Daria's emotions onto
the paper.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura looks annoyed at having her work noticed, but
remembers her view of Ms. Defoe, and changes to a neutral pose.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;That is the point.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Most artists put their own emotions onto the canvas
and the person being drawn.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You pull the
emotions to you from the person through the canvas.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura's mind hears the echoes of a conversation with her
great-grandfather as he makes a sketch of the young girl.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He tells his young student, &quot;The
secret?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Oh, so many secrets.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But this one I'll tell you.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You pull the emotions to you from the person
through the trump.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The person, if they
will, will follow through the image.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Coming back to the here and now, Jalura smiles warmly,
with a touch of sharing an inside joke.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;Of course.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How else can one
communicate to another through art?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Ms. Defoe, hearing only the surface of the answer,
nods.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;You really should talk to
Jane Lane.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I think she prefers abstract
work because it gives her freedom to express her own emotions in art.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;We've met.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>And I'm looking forward to seeing her work.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Ms. Defoe, now speaking to a fellow artist and not to a
student, a tone usually only heard in this building when Ms. Defoe is speaking
to Jane, &quot;You can probably learn more from each other than either can from
me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The tone shift is not lost on Jalura.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;I'll keep that in mind.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thank you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The conversation also is not lost on Daria Morgendorffer,
who is wandering past the Art Room on her way to the library.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
Lawndale High Library<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria is acknowledged by the librarian, who is used to
seeing Daria in the afternoon.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Daria
goes to the card catalog, opens the bottom right drawer and riffs through the
cards for a moment before closing the drawer and heading toward the
stacks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The librarian, assuming that
Daria is looking for Emile Zola, sighs, anticipating Daria's disappointment that
the only Zola is one that Daria has already read.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The librarian is surprised, however, when
Daria returns quickly with a stack of small books, but nevertheless checks them
out to Daria.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria purposefully puts the books into her bag, then
leaves.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Lawndale
High Gym<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Today, Tiffany is also present.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But, after yesterday's performance, there are
no volleyball nets set up.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Ms. Morris has a particularly angry glint in her
eye.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Today, girls, we run.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>As the girls all begin to trudge toward the track
adjacent to the gym, Ms. Morris steps in front of Jalura.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;How fast can you run, girl?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The ice cold voice returns, &quot;Far faster than
anything you could send after me, mortal.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Ms. Morris senses that she is outmatched, and steps
aside.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria mutters to herself as she walks past a confused Ms.
Morris.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Damn corkboard.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
track<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura runs at an even pace, literally lapping the other
girls.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>By the end of forty-five minutes,
Jalura makes eleven full loops around the one-mile track, where no one else,
even members of the track team, makes more than seven.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jalura looks less tired than most of the
other girls.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Ms. Morris again steps in front of Jalura as the girls
head toward the showers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;Impressive.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You should try
out for the track team.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Are you the coach?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No thanks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
don't like your attitude.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And
Jalura walks back into the building, leaving Ms. Morris standing again stunned.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
locker room.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria, clearly uncomfortable, approaches Jalura.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Hi.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Daria.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hey,
I'm sorry for prying yesterday.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Ummm.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
guess I kind of asked for it with my own questions.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The two leave the building and start down the street.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura shrugs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;So what's up?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria is not as relieved at the offer to change the
subject as Jalura thinks the former would be.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Daria hesitates, and then says, &quot;My mother thought it would be nice
to welcome you and your family to Lawndale.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I think it is as much that she wants to check out my new friend as
anything else.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you and your family
aren't doing anything Thursday night ... um ...&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I'd love to come to dinner Thursday.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There's just one catch.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It'll only be me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I live here with a
housekeeper/chaperone/bodyguard.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My
father is ... well, we're all pretty sure he's dead this time.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My mother is ... back home.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The explanation poses more questions than it
answered.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Eight:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>bodyguard?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Nine:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>dead 'this time?'&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;What happened to seven?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Obscurantist references, remember.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And don't try to change the subject.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura stops and faces Daria.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;I will answer your questions, if they
are still questions in your mind, when you answer the one I put to you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria freezes, and would probably utter a Brittany-esque
&quot;Eep&quot; except that Jalura raises her hand in a 'halt' gesture and
speaks again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;I know it isn't easy
to confront yourself and your fears and your pain.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But you'll have to do it sometime or those
fears and pains will destroy you.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I've
seen it happen, and I've seen people,&quot; fingers the lettering on her jacket
tenderly, &quot;become strong by facing those fears.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I want to help you.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And I'm willing to wait until you are
ready.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;If you start into a chorus of 'Dulcinea,' I will
hit you, not that I think it would do any good.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura smiles, &quot;I think you're more the Don Quixote
type than I; much more likely to go tilting at windmills, and giving woe to the
wicked.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Points down the
street.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Speaking of Sancho Panza,
though, I'm headed to Jane's.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She's
going to show me some of her art.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Join
us?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No. I've got some stuff to do.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura decides not to push further than she already
has.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Okay.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>See you tomorrow.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And I'm looking forward to
Thursday.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And heads down the
street.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria turns toward home, and mutters to herself,
&quot;Where do they grow cork trees?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>La Casa
Lane<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura rings the doorbell and Jane opens it.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Come on in.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura enters, and Jane stands at the door for a moment.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Daria said she had some stuff to do.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Oh.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Before Jane can comment further or even close the door,
the resonant tones of a Mystik Spiral rehearsal hammer their way through the
floor from the basement.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura frowns at the sound, and asks, &quot;Who is
torturing that guitar, and why?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jane smiles, &quot;That is my brother Trent and his
band.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They're not bad.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No, they're worse.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And with that, Jalura strides unerringly to
the basement door and heads downstairs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Jane closes the door and follows, curious.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>As Jalura comes to the bottom of the stairs, she sees the
band.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The final chords of a still-rough
version of &quot;Icebox Woman&quot; assault the senses as Jalura approaches.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>She looks at Trent sternly, places one hand across the
neck of the guitar and removes it from Trent before he can say anything.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura says, in a soft tone, to the guitar, &quot;It's
alright; I won't let him hurt you anymore.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then with a calm hand, adjusts the settings
on the amp, dropping the volume, evening the bass, and touching down the
tremolo.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Next, Jalura makes slight
adjustments to the tuning on the guitar.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura then begins to play, and what happens then would
be question ten for Daria, had she been there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If one could picture Andres Segovia and Eric Clapton having a child who
inherited and synthesized the full measure of musical ability from the two,
Jalura's playing would be the result.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>For fifteen full minutes a melodic European rhythm dances serenely among
jazz, blues, rock and occasional touches of raga influences to weave a tapestry
of music never before heard on this plane of Shadow.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When she finally stops, silence reigns
until...<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&lt;reverent&gt;&quot;Whoa.&quot;&lt;/reverent&gt; from
Trent.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&lt;reverent&gt;&quot;Yeah.&quot;&lt;/reverent&gt; from
Jane and Jesse simultaneously.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura gently puts the guitar on its stand and turns that
soul-reading look on Trent.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;What angers you the most is that there is so little
else that fuels your anger.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You seek
pain for power, but that is not your path.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You come closer than most to true harmony and peace with the world
around you.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Revel in that peace and echo
that harmony; do not rebel against it by casting it aside.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jane may not have spent as much time with Jalura as has
Daria, but neither do the encounters with people at the Pizza King and
elsewhere past Jane.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She is mentally
fitting herself for her own mental cork memo board as she says, &quot;Trent,
she-who-sees-your-soul-and-doesn't-laugh is Jalura Duquesne.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jalura, this is my brother, Trent.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The others are Jesse, Nick, and Max.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Hey.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Hi.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Great stuff,&quot; say the three other members of
Mystik Spiral in greeting.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Trent just continues to stare at Jalura as the words she
spoke sink in.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yo, Trent.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You aren't sleeping standing up again, are you bro?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Trent finally returns to the here and now, with,
&quot;Huh, no Janey.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jane turns to Jalura and says, &quot;You seem to have
quite an emotional effect on people.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Upchuck excepted, of course.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;You assume he's human?&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As the eyebrow re-cocks and loads.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Don't go using that twisty-turny rhetoric on
me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But yeah.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He's more like a force of nature.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;A whiny obnoxious little force of
nature.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jalura turns back to Trent
and places a hand on his arm.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;Trent, you have talent.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Play what is in your soul, and the people will listen.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you find anger, explore it, but trust your
peace unless you find that anger.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Jalura takes Jane by the arm and starts up the stairs, &quot;Come on,
let's go see what images your soul produces.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>As the two reach the top of the stairs, the faint sounds
of Trent playing &quot;The Sounds of Silence&quot; can be heard by Jane.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>In her head, Jane hears herself saying
&lt;reverent&gt;&quot;Whoa.&quot;&lt;/reverent&gt;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The two make their way up to Jane's room.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jane, in her best tour guide mode, says, &quot;Ta da.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Here recreated solely for this exhibit is the
studio of Jane Lane.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was in a small
bedroom much like this one where the world-renowned artiste created many of her
early works.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some of which are even on
display here in the room.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura, however, is silent as she glares at the rampant
lion on the wall near Jane's bed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Involuntarily, she pulls her Hellriders jacket tightly about her.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;So, what do you want to see first?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Figure studies, landscapes, abstracts?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura snaps out of her reverie.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Ummmm.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Ms. Defoe recommended your abstracts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Let's see those, and save people for last so that we can compare
styles.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Righty-oh.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>And in Jane's head, &quot;And don't think I didn't see your face when
you saw that poster, missy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is the
first I've seen you not completely dominate your surroundings.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And I want to know why.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Morgendorffer's house, Daria's room.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria enters after another dinner of pre-packaged lasagna
and Eric interrupting with some pointless nonsense and Quinn going on about her
pending date.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Daria is grateful that her
parents didn't pry after telling them that Jalura would come, but that her
parents couldn't.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A small wicked thought
crosses Daria's mind to have Helen question Jalura about the latter's parents,
a thought that doesn't get dismissed as quickly as Daria thinks it ought.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She is about to pick up one of the paperbacks
from her bag when the phone rings.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Hello?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yo, Daria.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Hi Jane.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How
did Jalura like your art?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;She liked it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Definitely prefers life study to abstract, but to each one's own.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Err, yeah.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Actually, I wanted to talk to you about her.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I'm listening.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Okay, first, that stunt with Upchuck.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I can top that with stuff from gym class.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;How?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Jane, how many miles can you run in an hour?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;With a good warm-up, nine, maybe a little
more.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;With no warm-up, Jalura did eleven times around the
track in gym period.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot; ... &quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Jane?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I'm here; I'm just trying to picture that.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;The comment you heard Monday was after Jalura spent
the whole period serving in volleyball.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;So, her team won a lot of points. That --&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not one
of Jalura's serves was returned.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not one
was even touched.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>_And_, Jalura caught
the ball one-handed when Ms. Morris threw it at Jalura; threw it hard like Ms.
Morris was trying to bean Jalura.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Okay.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She's
damn good at everything she does, and snubs the Fashion Club and she likes
us.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She's perfect.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She's more real than real life.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So, why am I vaguely and progressively
nervous around her?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I don't know.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Did she hit you with that soul-read thing of hers?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Not me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Trent.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot; ... &quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Daria?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I'm here.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I'm just trying to picture that.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Seems she didn't like the way Trent was
playing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She took his guitar and played
it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She's damn good.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Softer style, I couldn't begin to tell you
what all was in it, but it was damn good.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Then she hit Trent with that soul thing and what she told him locked him
up tighter than you get when you're around him.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Testily, &quot;We're talking about Jalura.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;So we are.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>She picked the wrong town to come to since she doesn't like lions.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;You know that English soccer poster on my wall, the
one with the lion?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yeah?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;She just about froze when she saw it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Spooked her bad.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Okay.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Anything else?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Next, is her own art work.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Let me guess.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Extraordinarily detailed miniature portraits.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You feel as if you are falling into them when
you look at them too long.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;You've seen them?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But,&quot; glances at the unopened paperback, &quot;I've been reading about
them.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;What do you mean?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Has her work been shown somewhere?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I don't think so.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Look, this doesn't make any sense.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Well, except in one impossible way.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I'll talk to her tomorrow.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Oh, Daria, one more thing you should know before
you talk to her ....&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yeah?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Her most recent work is a picture of you.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When I look at it, I understand why this
country's indigenous people thought photographs of them stole their
souls.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Damn.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So
much for a rational explanation of everything.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Impossibility it is.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Huh?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Never mind.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Just be careful around her until I've talked to her.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A thing forward toward which I am _not_
looking.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Chez
Duquesne<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura walks in.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Trinsch does not look happy.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Thank goodness you're home safe.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I nearly called you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura is instantly alert.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;What is it?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Tracker rat breached the ten Shadow perimeter.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It didn't penetrate the five Shadow
line.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Did it detect the sensors?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I don't think so.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Not unless he's gotten a lot subtler.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Alright.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>After dinner, I need to make some calls.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Of course, though Martin's schedule doesn't have
him back in range for another six days local frame.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I also need to call Dworkin.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I strongly advise against that, your Grace.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I know everyone considers him stable now, but
....&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;The alternative is Corwin, who, as of the last
we've heard, had disappeared.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Trinsch recognizes the tone in Jalura's voice.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;As you wish, Your Grace.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Part 3:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Wednesday<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mr.
O'Neill's English Class<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot; ... So you see, class, what Shakespeare is trying
to tell us is that Hamlet is confronted by doubt as to what he must do in
regard to the ghost's message.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;If it is really a ghost of his father, and not
Satan trying to trick Hamlet into doing evil by appearing in the guise of the
ghost of his father.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes, exactly, Jalura.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Please continue.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mr. O'Neill's ability to remember names would
seem to be in direct proportion to the student's knowledge of the subject.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>But before Jalura can continue, Stacy Rowe
interrupts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Wait.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why would Hamlet think Satan was
involved?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura half-turns in her seat, recognizes Stacy and is
about to berate her when Jalura notices that Sandi is glaring at Stacy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;An excellent question, Stacy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Though Christian, the Danes were also
influenced by the Teutonic and Norse mythoi, so the concept of Loki/Trickster
was well known to them as a shape shifter.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In the Christian sense, Trickster is evil, though that is a gross
oversimplification of a complex process among avatar deities.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Suffice it to say that Hamlet's upbringing
would lead him to suspect evil from his uncle, which is apparently what he
wants to hear from the ghost, but his honor makes him doubt his desire.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He&quot; and Jalura casts a sharp glance at
Mr. O'Neill, who flinches under her stare and words &quot;fears that he
projects his desires unto the ghost, and thus fears that it is Trickster/Satan
telling Hamlet what he wants to hear to goad him to action that would be
dishonorable.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the ghost is Satan,
then the ghost is lying and killing Claudius would be evil.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the ghost is Hamlet's father, then the
ghost is telling the truth, and killing Claudius is just and proper
vengeance.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;But couldn't the ghost lie if it is the ghost of
Hamlet's father?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura shakes her head, &quot;No, Stacy, it would serve
no purpose for the ghost.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Stacy does not cringe, as there is no malice in Jalura's
voice.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sandi continues to glare, but her
focus is now on Jalura, who meets the glare with a small, Mona Lisa smile
before turning back to the front.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
cafeteria.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Upchuck is carrying a fairly heavily-laden tray toward a
table.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He sees Jalura, drops the tray
and runs from the room.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura offers a Mona Lisa smile at his retreating back
and continues to slice her banana into very small pieces.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Outside
Ms. Li's office.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Sandi is waiting to talk to Ms. Li about Jalura, and
overhears a surprising conversation.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I quite sympathize, Ms. Morris, but there is
nothing I can do.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The embassy called
this morning and was quite clear that we are to accept some unusual behavior
from Jalura.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;She refused to join the track team, but she's the
fastest long-distance runner I've ever seen.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If she could keep the pace she ran in gym yesterday, she could break two
hours in the marathon.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And her volleyball
skills....<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ms. Li, you've got to talk to
her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She could be a one-woman sports
team.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Think of what those titles and
trophies would mean to Lawndale.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;As much as I would like to, I can't.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The embassy was quite clear that &lt;mock
reverent&gt;Her Grace&lt;/mock reverent&gt; could not be in such a high-profile
position.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And you know that I seek every
opportunity to enhance the honor of &lt;reverent&gt;Lawndale
High&lt;/reverent&gt; but they were quite clear that legal action would follow
if we, and I quote, pressured Princess Jalura or further annoyed her.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Sandi's mind may not move quickly on some subjects, but
she understands royalty quite well.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Sandi rises, and heads back to class.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;This calls for an emergency meeting of
the Fashion Club.&quot; she mutters to herself as she walks away.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
Gym.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Today it is basketball.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>A somewhat subdued Ms. Morris curtly, but politely, asks
Jalura if she's good at basketball.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Jalura looks at her, recognizing the still-present malice as well as the
leash holding it at bay, and decides to give the teacher a break.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;I've never played.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I've only seen the game once on
television.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ummmm, it isn't played where
I come from.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Inside Daria's mind, &quot;Ten.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Oh, hell, infinity.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Ms. Morris looks suddenly relaxed; she has something over
this girl at last.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Well, why don't
you just sit and watch today.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You won't
get participation points, but that's better than hurting yourself or others by
not knowing what you're doing.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>To both Ms. Morris' and Daria's surprise, Jalura agrees,
and sits down.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Daria looks as if she's
about to join her, when she hears her name called to be on a team.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Daria's next surprise comes at the
realization of not being picked last as there are still two more people to be
chosen after her.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The game begins, and Daria stands near a corner.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Every so often the ball is passed to her, and
she dutifully passes it to another person.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>After about ten minutes, Stacy jumps for a rebound, but lands awkwardly
and begins limping.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Rowe.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sit
out.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I don't want you getting hurt worse
than you just made yourself.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Stacy looks at Ms. Morris, and obeys her.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Stacy hobbles over to the bleachers and sits
next to Jalura.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Hi.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thanks
for not yelling at me this morning.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
know it was a stupid question.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No, Stacy, it wasn't a stupid question at
all.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;But I saw your face before you started to
speak.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura thinks to herself, &quot;There's more to this girl
than at first appears,&quot; and says, &quot;Well, you are in the Fashion Club,
and I was just reacting.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When I thought
about your question, I realized that you really were paying attention to the
discussion.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Still, it was ...
kindofnicetobetakenseriouslyforachange.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;You don't get much of that, being taken
seriously?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Stacy looks down at her shoes for a long while before
answering.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;No.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I guess I bring it on myself.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, only because you try so hard to be liked that
you rarely do the things that make you worthy of being taken seriously.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Huh?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Look.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In
class today, you asked a question that maybe six students in this school would
have asked, the others being people like Daria, Jodie Landon, or Michael
MacKenzie before they studied the play.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You have intelligence.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Don't be
afraid of it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Look at Jodie; she's so
popular she's got to turn down activities because there aren't enough hours in
the day for her to do everything.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Look
at Daria; the teachers like her and, except for the Fashion Club, all the
popular people talk to her and consider her some level of friend, and Daria
goes out of her way to distance herself from most people.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why do you suppose that is?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The wheels begin to turn in Stacy's mind.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Well, they're both brains.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Uh-huh, so why are they popular?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, Jodie's on a sports team, and she's dating
Mack, and she's attractive.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And Daria?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Ummm.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
don't know.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Actually, Daria is quite attractive.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She dresses and acts in ways that hide it,
but the truth is there for those who can see it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But that still isn't why she's popular, or
why Jodie or Michael is popular.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Then I don't get it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura offers Stacy an indulgent smile.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;They have principles.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They have standards.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They know who they are, and won't compromise
that for others.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jodie's probably a
little more flexible about situational morality, but that isn't a bad
thing.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Y-you mean, they're popular because they don't try
to be popular?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Sort of.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Theirs is a different sort of popular.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It is based on respect, not clothes or looks or money.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>People like Jodie and Daria and Michael are
popular because those three command the respect of those around them.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They're the ones who'll make it in this world
... because they get to define their goals and achievements.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;But ....&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No 'buts.'<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They define their worlds.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I can
see it in their eyes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Quinn could learn
to do it, and probably already would be doing it if she didn't have to see
Daria succeeding easily at it where it is still a struggle for Quinn.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You could do it, too.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you can find the courage to stand up to Sandi.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Because once you can stand up to her, then
you can confront your parents.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You
don't know what you're talking about.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Stacy looks like she is about to get up.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Sit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Now.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The automatic reply leaves Stacy's mouth before she is even conscious of
it, and freezes on the bench with a look in her eyes that would make a deer
caught in headlights seem confrontational by comparison.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Hearing those two words, Jalura turns the full force of
her soul-reading on Stacy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So much pain,
so much broken trust, so much hiding from herself so that she could hide the
hurt from others.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Finally, Jalura speaks
with the voice of ice, one word.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;No.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jalura reaches
out, hugs Stacy, and then speaks much more softly.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;It will be alright.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Stacy, I had no idea how bad it was.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Forget about Sandi, we have more important
work to do.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Yells, &quot;Ms.
Morris.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Ms. Morris trots over, &quot;What is it, is her ankle
getting worse?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura looks at Stacy, &quot;No, but we do need to go to
your office _right now_.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Stacy has
something to tell you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Street
outside Lawndale High.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria and Jane watch as two police cars pull up.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The officers go inside.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;All I know is that Jalura and Stacy spoke for about
fifteen minutes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jalura did the
soul-read thing, called Ms. Morris over; they left and didn't come back.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;How do you know she did the soul-read?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;That's the frightening part.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is almost like I can feel it even though I
didn't actually see it happen.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Heck, I
was so distracted I actually shot a basket today.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Daria Morgendorffer actively participates in a
sporting event?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sweet god, that is the
third sign of the apocalypse.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Warn me if
you hear of any Americans understanding cricket.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That's the next sign, you know.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And the final sign is Jane Lane knowing when to
keep her mouth shut.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, then.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We can all rest easy, 'cause that'll never happen....<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You really 'felt' it happen?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I don't
know what is in Stacy's soul, but it is painful....<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Fashion Club might be like an anesthetic,
to numb her so she can function.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Okay Daria, I was joking about the sports, but now
you _are_ starting to freak me out.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;That's good.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I'd hate to be there alone.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Just then, Jalura comes out of the gym doors, and the
other three members of the Fashion Club come out the side doors of the school.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Titanic and iceberg on collision course, Captain
Lord.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jane looks at Daria, only partially comprehending her
remark.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then Jane sees Jalura and Sandi
approaching and gets most of the joke.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura sees the Fashion Club before they can see
her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jalura stops, and waits.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The Fashion Club walks up to Jane and Daria, and Sandi
slowly speaks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Um, Quinn's
cousin?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I have a name, Fashion Club President Jerk.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Oh, um.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Quinn just always refers to you as her cousin.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria shoots an angry glance at Quinn, &quot;My name is
Daria.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Okay, Daria. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>We want to talk to you about Jalura.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria and Jane each barely succeed at not looking in
Jalura's direction.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jane speaks, in a
passable imitation of Jalura's voice, &quot;What _do_ you want?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Sandi shudders at the repetition of those words that
humiliated her two days ago.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But royalty
must be appeased, even if it means speaking to these losers.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;We wanted to, uh ....<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Quinn, help me here.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Quinn rolls her eyes, and thinks, &quot;Arthur
Fonzarelli's got nothing on Sandi, here.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But says, &quot;Daria, we know we got off to a bad start with Jalura,
but we really think she'd be a valuable asset to the Fashion Club.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We want to apologize and offer Jalura
membership in the Fashion Club.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria notices the eye roll, and wonders what is going
through the Fashion Club's little mind.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;And you want me to talk to her?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Three heads nod, and Jane is suddenly inspired to do a
mobile of those little dogs whose heads bob up and down because the heads are
mounted on springs, only to replace the heads with the heads of Barbie dolls,
making one to look like each member of the Fashion Club.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, have you spoken with Stacy?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Sandi can deal with this.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;No, we haven't seen her all afternoon.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I'm not surprised.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Ever since she spoke with Jalura this afternoon, she's been in the gym
office with Ms. Morris.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The police just
arrived and I don't think those two statements are unrelated.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Sandi ponders this ... Sandi tries to understand this ...
Sandi has no idea how to interpret this.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I'm not sure what it means.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe you should ask Jalura.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Here she comes, now.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Daria yells, &quot;Jalura, the Fashion Club
wants to speak to you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jane thinks to herself, &quot;I gotta go to the same
college as Daria when we get out of here.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>She's just gonna get better with age.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura walks up.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;Um.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sandi, Quinn,
Tiffany.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We need to talk.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Turns to Daria and Jane.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;I'm sorry.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This has to be done privately.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I'll come by and explain it to you
later.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Street
in Lawndale, near Jane's house.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura is about to reach the corner of the lawn for La
Casa Lane when she feels a pressure at the back of her neck.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is Trinsch.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Your Grace?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura speaks sotto voce, &quot;This isn't a good
time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It had better be important.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes, ma'am.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Something penetrated the five Shadow line.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Fast enough that I couldn't get a good read
on it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It just crossed the one Shadow
wall.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I think it is a fire angel.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I need you to buy me one-half hour.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have something I have to do here.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Your Grace?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No, I'm not running.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It ... it's personal.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I shall do my best.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Of course.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>And Jalura breaks the contact.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura resumes walking and reaches the door of Jane and
Trent's house.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She rings the bell.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The door opens.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Hey.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Hello, Trent.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Are Daria and Jane here?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yeah, they said you'd be stopping by and to send
you up to Janey's room.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Thanks.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Jalura enters and heads up the stairs.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Knock, knock.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Even though the door is open and both Daria and Jane see
Jalura, Jane asks, &quot;Who's there?&quot; in a mocking tone.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria, however, is deadly serious.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Yes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Who are you, Jalura?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What are
you?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And what is going on?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura stops for a moment.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Ah, ah, ah, Daria.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You know my price for the first two
answers.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Those remarks draw a
quizzical look from Jane, cast in Daria's general direction.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;As for the last ....&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jalura closes the door and sits on the floor
in front of her friends.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I talked to Stacy today.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria's anger seeps through her voice.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Yes, I know.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Next time you do that soul-read thing, be far
away from me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;You mean you felt it?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What did you perceive?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Pain.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Betrayal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Fear.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The usual.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, you only got the surface, then.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Stacy regularly is being abused sexually by
her father.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Has been since she entered
puberty.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Both Jane and Daria gasp audibly.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria struggles, finally finding words.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Oh, my god.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had no idea.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Will she be alright?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What did you do?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura's voice is cold ice.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;I didn't kill him.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I didn't even go near him for fear that I
would.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Stacy was my priority, and once
she started talking to Ms. Morris, just about everything came out.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ms. Morris called the police first, Ms. Li
second.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Stacy's in protective custody
and a bench warrant has been issued for her father.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jane finds her voice, &quot;And the Fashion Club?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I needed to ask them if any of them had been
molested by Stacy's father.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I believe
Quinn and Tiffany's denials, but am not sure about Sandi's.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria looks down at the floor.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;I should, um, probably go home and make
sure Quinn is okay.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I think she actually
likes Stacy, so she'll be taking this pretty hard.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jane is astonished to see her best friend actually care
about Quinn, who treats Daria like dirt.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But Jane knows she'd do the same for any of her siblings, no matter how
screwed up they are.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Plus, Jane has an
ulterior motive for speaking to Jalura alone.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;Umm, yeah.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That's probably
a good idea.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria leaves.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>As soon as Daria's boots can no longer be heard on the
stairs, &quot;Alright, missy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You may
have some bargain with Daria that keeps her from demanding answers, but you
don't with me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Who are you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Jane, you wouldn't believe me if I told you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Try me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Maybe later.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I've got to go now to take care of some other business.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jalura rises, and heads toward the door.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jane gets up, to try to stop her, but Jalura is moving
quickly, and gets out of the room.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jane continues to follow Jalura.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>When Jalura gets to the front door, she turns and tells
Jane, &quot;Don't you ever follow me again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You only have one life.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you
value it, stay home.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And heads out
the door.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Whoa.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What
was that all about, Janey?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jane looks at Trent.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;I don't know, but I'm going to find out.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jane reaches the door and opens it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She runs up to the street, but Jalura is
nowhere to be seen.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
Morgendorffer's house.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Quinn's bedroom.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria knocks tentatively.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;May I come in?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Whatever.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria is shocked for not the first time today.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Quinn is wearing an oversized sweatshirt and
baggy jeans and has removed all her makeup.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>As Daria enters, Quinn is removing the nail polish from her toenails.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Are you ... okay?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Quinn looks as if she is about to cry.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;No.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria doesn't blame her one bit.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Do you ... want to talk about
it?&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Daria is a little bit
surprised that she is doing this, and then realizes that she has to do this.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Unbeknownst to either of the girls, Helen has arrived
home, for once having left the office right at 5:00 PM.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She hears most of the conversation.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>'Hears' is a euphemism for 'eavesdrops on.'<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Quinn is amazed that Daria is reaching out to her sister
when Quinn needs someone.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And the
realization that it is Daria comforting her, and not anyone from the Fashion
Club, becomes note number one on Quinn's mental cork message board.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;You don't mind, after the way I've
treated you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria looks at her sister and tries to be gentle.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Quinn, you've never treated me well,
but aside from the 'only child' bit, you've never actually hurt me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You're my sister, even though we rarely act
like it, and that's all that matters right now.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Quinn fiercely hugs Daria, who stiffens, then relaxes and
slowly returns the hug.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Quinn begins to cry.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;How could he ... (sob) ... do that ... (sniffle) his own daughter
... Stacy ... (shudder) ... she's so young ... ewwww.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I don't know why he did it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You're right, though, about the 'ewwww'
aspect of it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;My god, Daria, I've ... (shudder) ... slept ... in
that house.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What if he ... (sob)
....&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Quinn, I'm very glad that neither of us has much
knowledge about this subject, but I think that he would be too afraid of
witnesses to do anything when the whole Fashion Club was there.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>In the hallway, Dawn Breaks Over Marblehead as Helen
realizes exactly what her daughters are discussing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Helen's shudder measures on the Richter
scale, but is unnoticed by her daughters.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;But ... Jalura ... (whimper) ... when she ... Sandi
....&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I know.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Jalura told me that she isn't sure if anything happened to Sandi.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But remember that Sandi has lived here her
whole life.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Tiffany has only been here a
couple of years, and we've only been here ... not even two months.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;But ... his own daughter?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Quinn, there are some truly evil people in the
world.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are also people who define
right and wrong very differently than we would.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I don't claim to know which type Stacy's father is, but either way, he
is sick.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It might be the kind of sick
that a just world would deem so dangerous as to need to be eradicated, or he
might be sick in a way that can be treated.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I just don't know which.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;But, b-b-b ... (sob)&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria knows that the big question is coming, and she
hopes she has an answer for it that won't hurt Quinn.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Quinn finally speaks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;Is the Fashion Club responsible?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Did we make Stacy be too attractive?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Did we make him do this?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen thinks to herself, &quot;If Daria pulls this answer
off well, there will be Daria's choice of a late-model used car in the driveway
or a brand new computer on the desk for Daria's birthday next month, and to
hell with the budget.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria struggles, and then finally speaks.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The stoic mask is completely gone from her face
as she tenderly strokes Quinn's hair, not that Quinn notices with her face
still buried in Daria's shoulder.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;No.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This started before
Stacy was in the Fashion Club.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>From what
I can tell and from what Jalura said, Stacy loves being in the Fashion Club
because it lets her pretend to be normal for a little while, whatever the hell
normal is.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But that feeling gives her
the energy to survive one more night of abuse.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It has kept her alive until someone could see what was happening and
intervene.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And, she does see you as her
true friend.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It will take a long time,
but she will be okay if you remain that for her.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen thinks to herself.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;That may just merit both the car and the computer.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Well, Daria does still have to pass her
driving test.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Better have Maryanne start
shopping for ... No, Damnit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I will do
this myself.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Back in the room, Quinn is still crying.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Oh, Daria.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why didn't _I_ see it?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Stacy really is my friend.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why didn't I see it?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Quinn.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Stacy
has had years of practice hiding it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You
would have figured it out eventually.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Jalura has ... some special skills and experience at reading
people.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She truly had the outsider's
perspective on the situation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was
just a little faster than you at it, that's all.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen realizes that she has seriously underestimated her
elder daughter's emotional maturity, and vows that she will pay much more
attention to Daria in the future.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Quinn finally unburies herself from Daria's
shoulder.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Daria, I ...&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I know.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let me
say this.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I don't always treat you with
the respect you deserve.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Probably in a
few weeks, I'll start ignoring you again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But, for once, I am going to tell you to your face that I am proud to
have you for my sister.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Ummm.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Thanks, Quinn.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now, before Mom
and Dad get home,&quot; Helen takes her cue, and wonders if it is a cue as she
heads downstairs to make a more audible entrance, &quot;you need to put your
makeup back on and wear normal-for-you clothes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Being popular and attractive didn't make what happened happen.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I can't believe I'm going to say this, but
there is nothing wrong with being popular or attractive, so long as there's
something more in your life.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Right now,
the most important thing you can be is Stacy's friend.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe after dinner, you ... we could talk to
Mom about offering to let Stacy stay in our guest room for a while until things
settle down for her.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Daria, you'd be willing to put up with a
near-constant Fashion Club meeting for Stacy?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No, I'd spend as much time as possible at
Jane's.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But Stacy's going to need you
and I can put up with a lot in light of her situation.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Downstairs, Helen audibly 'comes home.'<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria gets up, pauses at the door.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Both, simultaneously, &quot;We never had this
conversation.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Daria adds,
&quot;Except the part about talking to Mom after dinner.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now get some makeup on.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You almost look like me without my glasses
on, and that scares me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Quinn smiles at her sister, and reaches for her mirror.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria closes the door behind her, softly, and
mutters.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Damn conscience.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Damn emotions.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Damn that Jalura; she owes me big for
this.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>the
woods at the north edge of Lawndale<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Trinsch is fighting a desperate battle against a fire
angel.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For those of you who haven't read
Zelazny's second Chronicles of Amber, a fire angel is a rather large fire demon
with wings and multiple hearts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A
fearsome fighter, and a very programmable assassin, usually works in pairs.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Trinsch is employing a rather interesting combination of
ice, silicon dust and fury against the demon and Trinsch appears to have doused
the flame of its right wing and arm.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura appears behind Trinsch, her hand appearing on his
shoulder.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Not bad, handling a trump 'port in
mid-battle.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I do my job.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And you do it well.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Now stand back.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Trinsch gladly steps aside.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even though he is Jalura's bodyguard, he
knows that he is no match for her in blade, spell or trump combat.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura begins to hum, something sounding vaguely
Musogorsky-ish.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The fire angel lunges
from the left side, and is about to strike Jalura in the head when it suddenly
disappears, leaving a trail of charred earth for the forty or so meters before
it is destroyed.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Rhapsody in Relative Inertia.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I owe Lore one for that spell.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Trinsch is impressed with the rapid dispatch of the fire
angel.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;How does the spell
work?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Basically, it places the subject at rest with
regard to the universe.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Unfortunately
for the subject, the rest of the universe keeps on moving.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Few beings can survive long against a
planet-load of inertia, heat, friction, etc [pronounced by Jalura as
'et-k'].&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;An impressive spell.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And to think I got it from one of Brand's
sons.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You know, if it weren't for that,
I'd probably trust him.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And the fact that he's homosexual?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Remember, I have a touch of shape shifting
ability.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Gender becomes ... less
relevant at that point.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I see.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I've had a long day.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I want nothing more than a long hot bath,
dinner and sleep.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Of course, Your Grace.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Chez
Duquesne<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria rings the doorbell.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>After a minute, the door opens.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Trinsch has a large bandage on his left arm,
a reminder of the afternoon's battle.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;Yes?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I want to talk to Jalura.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I am afraid that she is unavailable for the
remainder of the evening.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>May I tell her
who has called?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>From inside the house, &quot;Wait.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That's Daria.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Let her in, please.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Trinsch steps aside, allowing Daria to enter.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Damn you, Jalura.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Nice to see you, too.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Leave us, Trinsch.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes, ma'am.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Trinsch leaves.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;To what do I owe the emotional outburst?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;You made it happen.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You forced me to face my emotions and now I can feel them almost as
strongly as you can.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That's how I could
sense your soul-read of Stacy and even feel part of what she felt.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And why I had to go to Quinn this afternoon
and start putting Humpty Dumpty back together again by talking Mom into having
Stacy live with us for a while.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Daria pauses, then continues, &quot;The answer to your damn question is
this:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No, I never did.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I just got let down so often that I
temporarily lost the ability to rise as high as I was before each fall.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had to keep my emotions in check to keep my
sanity.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The pain was so great that I
couldn't face it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then you had to find
the one person in Lawndale whose pain was worse than mine, and force me to see
it, just to drive me to my own epiphany.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But, you just wanted to hear me say that.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now answer my questions, damn you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Please sit down.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I think you'll need it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria is still angry, but sits down.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;I'm waiting.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;First, Stacy is not the only person whose pain is
worse than yours.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria's anger melts, rather like one of Jake's
deflations.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;I know that.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I'm a little rusty at emotions.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura looks at her and nods.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;All right.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Second, I didn't need to hear you say
it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I needed you to hear yourself say
it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Weakly, &quot;Damn you to Hell.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;If you wish, but first let me answer the questions
about me.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jalura looks at Daria,
who nods weakly.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Have you read much science fiction?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I've lately read a lot of Zelazny.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The reference goes completely past Jalura, and Daria
senses that fact with considerable confusion.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura offers a faint smile.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;I was thinking more of Douglas
Adams.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hitchhiker's Guide to the
Galaxy.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;What does that have to do with this?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Have you read it?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;All four books of the trilogy.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura smiles, knowing the joke well.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Do you remember the spot where Zaphod
is put in the Total Perspective Vortex, a device that shows him exactly where
in the universe he is?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yeah, but the powers that be created a pocket
universe just for Zaphod so that when he entered the chamber, he was the center
of a universe created just for him.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Exactly.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Pointedly,
&quot;Zaphod Morgendorffer.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Excuse me?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;This whole world exists so that you have a place to
be real.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The look of non-comprehension on Daria's face is overwhelming.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Thank you.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For my birthday, would you kindly give me a
world that doesn't suck?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Daria, I am serious.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I can tell.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I just don't understand.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I know
there's no rational explanation for everything that's happened since you got
here.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was sure that, even if you
aren't mentioned in the Chronicles, you were from Amber.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura rises, &quot;How the Hell do you know about
Amber?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Zelazny.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
told you I'd read it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Part Two:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The Chronicle of Merlin.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Granted
only the first book of the second part has come out.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But Zelazny promises four more.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The look of horror on Jalura's face is frightening.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Oh, no.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>No!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I couldn't have missed
something like that.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now talking
to herself, &quot;This has to be some little joke spell that Merlin put on
me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No, not Merlin.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The tracker rat.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Of course.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Dalt hit me with that energy weapon in the Star Trek: Next Generation
Shadow.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If it also had Magick in it,
there could have been a latent spell.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
didn't scan for Magick after I got up.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
was too busy chasing Dalt.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Damn.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Trinsch re-enters on hearing Jalura's raised voice.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Your Grace?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura regains her composure.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Trinsch, we have a problem.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>A raised eyebrow awaits elaboration.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura sighs, and then speaks.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;When I was in the Next Generation
Shadow, just before I met Merlin, I fought Dalt.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes, ma'am.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I know that.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;He hit me with an energy weapon.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;You mentioned that.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He appeared annoyed that you survived, and fled.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You gave chase, but he lost you in a nest of
Shadow-spanning black hole nebulae.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That's where Merlin found you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria joins in the discussion by pulling six paperbacks
from her bag.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She offers them to
Trinsch, and says, &quot;According to Jalura, the weapon also put a tracking
spell on her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This Dalt person probably
figured she would lead him to a lot more members of the royal family of
Amber.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Apparently, the spell manifests
itself by causing these to appear in the Shadow where she is.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Trinsch frowns as he scans the back covers.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Oh.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Then this afternoon was just a warm-up.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>A test of his locating abilities.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He has become much more subtle.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria says, without a trace of smile, &quot;Lions,
unicorns and Amber, oh my.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura frowns, but nods.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;Yes, Dalt has two symbols.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>One is the rampant lion.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That is
for his homeland.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The other is the
rampant lion rending an inverted unicorn.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That is his personal symbol.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;That explains the reaction to Jane's soccer
poster.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now, about the jacket?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Trinsch, if you would please.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Trinsch wordlessly goes to the closet and brings out his
own Hellriders jacket.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He puts it on and
speaks slowly.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;His Majesty, Prince
Martin, heir to the thrones of Rebma and Amber, has bestowed these jackets upon
members of his band, the Hellriders.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Though they convey no special powers, they are highly prized throughout
Shadow, and are symbols of his personal aegis.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura continues.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;Trinsch was Martin's drummer and bodyguard for nearly ten
years.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He is now my bodyguard.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My jacket is because Martin named me an
honorary roadie for the band.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Martin and
Merlin are the only two members of the royal family that I trust.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I see.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This
Dalt.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What is his beef with Amber?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;He is a son of Oberon.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A son by rape.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jalura pauses to let the impact of that
statement flow into Daria following the events of the day, those at least of
which Daria is aware.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Oberon later
killed his mother in battle after she began desecrating unicorn shrines.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And his beef against you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I am a member of the royal family of Amber and of
the Golden Circle kingdom of Gaiga, with whom Dalt's most recent employer,
Kashfa, has been at war.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Those facts
make me a likely first target.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And your connection to the royal family of
Amber?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I am the daughter of Caine.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;'Du' Caine.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I get it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Boy, the Golden Circle
must be a breeding stable for the royal family.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura stiffens.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;Do not repeat that statement in my, or any member of the royal
family's, presence if you wish to live.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria blanches, believing Jalura to be fully capable of,
and willing to be, carrying out that threat.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Daria tries to shift the subject.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;Why here?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why me?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I took temporary refuge with Merlin after the
battle I mentioned.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He has his own
difficulties with the family.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;So I read.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes, I don't suppose the book identifies his
would-be assassin?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No, it doesn't.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Doesn't mention Dalt either.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
bookstore says the next book is due out in about six weeks.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Damn.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Anyway, Merlin sent me away, to keep me from being, as he put it, an
extra target a few days ago.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I would
have gone to Martin, but he is on a diplomatic mission to the Courts of Chaos,
and beyond, and I cannot reach him there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But I digress.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While in Merlin's
apartment, I was watching television.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Nasty habit that.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>My favorite vice.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura smiles, much to Daria's relief, and
continues.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;And that's where I saw
you.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Or, at least, Merlin's Shadow's
television's MTV's version of you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Okay.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I watched you go through some sort of college
weekend.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You looked like the kind of
person I'd consider a friend.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I needed a
place, and a friend.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I rode until I got
... here.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then set up Trinsch and this
house.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;But what about all the background crap.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Where are the silver towers, fallen or otherwise?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura smiles indulgently.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Unfortunately, I skipped a lot of
details.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My goal was to create you, the
you that I saw on television.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The other
things, apparently, were the necessary and sufficient conditions to create
you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria stares, trying to absorb the fact that someone
created a world just for her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To Daria,
that knowledge seems far more maddening than to be seen as truly insignificant.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;More real than real.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura looks at Daria quizzically.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria sees the look and explains.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;More real than real.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That was Jane's description of you.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It fits far better than she realized.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes, I guess it does.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At least by the standards of Shadow.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria, still trying to grasp the new definition of
reality with which she is confronted, asks, &quot;So now what?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura looks away.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;I don't know.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I ... like it
here, despite its flaws.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I meant what I
told Michael and Jodie about having found friends here.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Friends you created whole cloth out of your
desire.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No, I didn't make you like me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My goal was to create you as I saw you, and
the rest I left to fate.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Which heavily favors the powerful.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Like Hamlet's wish that his father's ghost be
telling the truth, your desire to find a friend shaped this place and this me
as much as your desire to find this place.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria's allusion stuns Jalura; the very image Jalura had
used to chastise Mr. O'Neill that very morning is now thrown in her very own
face.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Fate indeed.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura's eyes close.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;I'm sorry.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Hey, I'm not complaining.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It actually doesn't matter that much to me
whether I like you from free will or from structural compulsion.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You are a good person, doing your best under
... exceptionally difficult circumstances.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I just want you to realize that I probably am as you made me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I want our friendship to be as honest as it
can be.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura opens her eyes, literally and metaphorically.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Thank you.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I'm not sure I deserve that friendship.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria gives Jalura a Mona Lisa smile.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Someone recently told me:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>'You chose to consider me as a friend, and I
accept that responsibility.'&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura's smile exactly matches Daria's.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Part 4:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thursday<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
Morgendorffer's<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;So, the Social Services Officer will pick Stacy up
after school, take her to her house to get some clothing and bring her here
around five.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Okay, Helen.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Five.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Should I come home
early?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen ponders Jake's question.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Mmm, no dear.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This might be better if she had a smaller
reception committee.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;If you think that's best.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I just wish you'd tell me why Stacy is going
to be living with us for a while.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Jake, I told you that that is none of your
business.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria enters.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Actually, Mom, I kind of agree with Dad on this
one.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If he knows what is going on he's
less likely to accidentally say something that will upset her.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, that's true Daria, but ...,” and Helen looks
at Jake.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There's no easy way to say
it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;What worries me is that
knowing, your father will try so hard to avoid saying anything that he'll
actually wind up talking about it constantly.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jake looks upset, &quot;You know, Helen, I am in the
room.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes, dear, I know.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>And after as long as we've been together, I think I know you well enough
to know how you'll react.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria's emotions are still raw from the events of
yesterday, and school suddenly sounds like an island of relative sanity.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;You two carry on without me, I've got
to go to school.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jake's mood swing is dizzying to all but him.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Okay, kiddo.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Have a great day.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And dinner'll be ready at five when your
friend gets here.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>As Daria walks out of the room, she corrects him.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Stacy, Quinn's friend, arrives at five
_tomorrow_.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Tonight, dinner with my
friend, Jalura, is at _six_.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;So what kind of name is Jalura, anyway?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Honestly, Jake!&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mr.
DiMartino's freshman History class<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Stacy's empty seat seems to be the focal point of the
room.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Everyone casts furtive glances at
the vacant spot.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Mr. DiMartino is no exception.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Class, I suppose by now everyone is
aware of Ms. Rowe's situation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I'm not
very good with emotional discussions, but for once I'd say you all have a
legitimate reason for not being able to participate in a class discussion.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Since I'm not willing to discuss Ms. Rowe,
why don't you all just view today as an extended study hall.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>A few general murmurs of appreciation are made, but
silence quickly takes over the room.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mr.
O'Neill's classroom<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Class, perhaps we should talk about how poor
Stacy's --&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura is in no mood to put up with this nonsense.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Perhaps I didn't make myself clear
yesterday.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Don't project your emotions
onto these people.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They don't understand
in general and they sure as hell don't understand this.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Get out.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Oh, my.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
know --&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Shut up.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Jalura storms out, slamming the door behind her.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Several students, led by Andrea, get up and leave behind
Jalura.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Mr. O'Neill begins to cry.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ms.
Barch's classroom<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;So, you see, class, even though women get cancer
just as often as men, the male-dominated health industry devotes more than ten
times the research money to studying cancers in men compared to cancers in
women.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Despite being surprised and grateful that Ms. Barch isn't
sermonizing about Stacy, Jalura can't abide the bias Ms. Barch is
displaying.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Ms. Barch, those
statistics are a little bit out of date.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, Ms. Duquesne, I didn't think _you_ would be
an apologist for the male health industry.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura's frown intensifies.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;I'm not apologizing for them.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I hold them every bit as responsible for
their bias in priorities as I do you in your bias in reporting.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;What?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Maybe you should read the editorial by Catherine
DeAngelis and Margaret Winter in the current review issue of JAMA.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;What's JAMA, some teenage pajama party guide
book?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No, JAMA is the acronym for 'Journal of the
American Medical Association.'<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
current review issue focuses on women's health, including some large-scale
studies on cancers in women, and an editorial on how much the study of women's
health has improved in just the last decade.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jalura reaches into her bag, and tosses a
journal to a stunned Ms. Barch.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Ms. Barch catches the journal, and opens it to the page
bookmarked with a post-it note.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ms.
Barch's frown deepens as she reads, flipping pages slowly.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>No one is going to risk the wrath of Barch by saying
anything.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Finally the bell rings, and
the students flee more eagerly than they usually do.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mr.
DiMartino's sophomore History class<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, you're still alive.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What's the story with Jalura?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Jane, you wouldn't believe me if I told you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Ha ha ha, Daria.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Those were her exact words to me when I confronted her after you left
yesterday.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Right before she quoted
almost word for word Connor MacLeod's lines from the alley scene after the
junkyard fight in 'Highlander' and right before she pulled a disappearing act
that would make Doug Henning proud.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Alright, I'll tell you at lunch, but not in the
cafeteria.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The roof
of Lawndale High<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Let me get this straight ....<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You're telling me that some near-omnipotent
being decided that something she saw on a cartoon in another dimension would
make a cool friend, and we exist because of that.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Both Jalura and I told you that you wouldn't
believe it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Okay, fine, joke over.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now, what's the real story?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria's mask is gone, and Jane can not long look at her
friend's face without feeling some of Daria's emotions.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jane finally finds words, &quot;More real than real,
huh?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And the more time we spend with her, the more real
we become.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Unless this Dalt guy catches us with her.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Just wear your poster, and you'll be safe
enough.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I think that's why she gave the trump of me to
Trinsch.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>His job is to get me to safety
if things go bad.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;But he's her bodyguard.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Apparently, sword-wielding speed bump is a more
accurate descriptor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He's there to slow
down whatever comes her way long enough for Jalura to choose her mode of combat
and get the first shot ready.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And I thought being a teenager sucked.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yeah, but he gets to wear a cool leather
jacket.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Oh, well.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That makes all the difference, then.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The two rise and start to head back down into
the building.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;By the way, what the
hell does 'misandristic' mean?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I've been
meaning to ask you that since I heard Jalura say it on Monday.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Helen's
office<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Eric, let me make this clear to you.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I am leaving for the rest of the week.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My cellular phone, as you can see, is on my
desk.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you call my home before I come
back into the office Monday, my first action on arrival at the office will be
to castrate you.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Do you understand that
I am not to be disturbed under any circumstances prior to my return on
Monday?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Eric looks non-plussed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;Helen you know that this is a very important case and --&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Eric, don't make me carry out my threat just to
prove to you that I don't make idle threats.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Helen walks out of the office.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Eric watches her retreating back, and says half to
himself, &quot;She's going to make a great partner here just as soon as enough
letters die off of the letterhead to make room for her.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Pizza
King<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;But, Babe, I don't get it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Michael knows this conversation won't end well.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;What don't you understand, Kevin?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;He's, like, old enough to be her father.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Brittany, Michael and Jodie just bow their heads in
wonder at the depths of Kevin's ignorance.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Morgendorffer's<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;So, Jalura.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Where exactly in Europe do you come from?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, Mrs. Morgendorffer, there are a number of
small principalities adjacent to one or more of the major nations of medieval
Europe.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sort of real-world versions of
the Duchy of Grand Fenwick, where some soldiers got lost in a war, found a
friendly village, conquered it, and no one realized it until years after the
war was over, and just left them in charge.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Those, like my homeland, that do not issue postage stamps or belong to
any of the UN agencies, are rarely depicted on world maps.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I've even seen some encyclopediae that don't
list it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I see.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Wait,
I thought all nations were members of the UPU.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Andorra,
Palau, and the Federated States of Micronesia are not members of the UPU
despite being members of the UN.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And,
then there are odd little places like Sealand with passports and postage stamps
and no permanent populations.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Quinn and Jake aren't even trying to follow this part of
the conversation.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Alright, I remember hearing about Sealand,
something about Britain periodically invading it just to annoy the man who owns
it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But that doesn't explain where you
come from.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria thinks to herself, &quot;There are times when it is
fun to have a lawyer for a parent.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Basically between Austria and Switzerland and
Italy.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;So your country ceased to exist during WWII?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No, no one bothered.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We were that far out of the way.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And so English isn't your native language?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Correct; my native tongue is Friulian.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Frisian?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No, Friulian.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Do not again confuse me with those unwashed German peasants.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I'm sorry, I'd never heard of Friulian.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Few have.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It
is spoken by fewer than 30,000 people in the whole world.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria decides to get her dig in, &quot;I thought your
native tongue was called Thari?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura's lack of reaction impresses Daria considerably,
as Jalura replies, &quot;No, that is for an adjacent land.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I'm ... related to their royal family, though
very far down the line of succession.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Well, actually, the languages do have a common origin.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Quinn perks up at the word 'royal' and joins the
conversation, &quot;So you're really a princess?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura chuckles, &quot;Yes, Quinn.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A real princess.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let me tell you something, though.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Being royalty sucks,&quot; and casts a quick
glance at Daria as she says that.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;Coming here has relieved me of a tremendous number of
duties.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;What?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You
_can't_ be serious.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Being a real
princess would be a dream come true.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Men
dripping at your feet, balls every night.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Servants.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Quinn says the
last word in very much the way Homer Simpson says the word 'donuts.'<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Quinn is almost glowing at the mere thought.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No, Quinn, it isn't like that at all.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>More like a perpetual detention in Mr.
DiMartino's class, with regular exams.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>As for balls, I usually spend four hours dancing with uncles and
great-uncles and cousins, and not a one under fifty.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Which should tell you about the alleged 'men
dripping at my feet.'<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And as for
servants, they serve the government and residence, not us; rulers come and go,
but the bureaucracy is eternal.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;But, all the shows about Princess Diana made her
life seem so wonderful.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Well, not the
paparazzi, but other than that ...&quot; she stops as she sees Jalura shaking
her head.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura offers Quinn an indulgent smile.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Quinn, Diana hated that life.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The constant performance, no privacy, the
expectations, the judgment of every action.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It may sound like fun, and parts of it might even be fun for a little
while, but the constant pressures were too much for her; they'd be too much for
anyone.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And I say that as someone who
has been raised to cope with that kind of pressure, albeit on a lesser
scale.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;But --&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No 'buts.'<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It isn't a fairy tale.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It can be
a nightmare, but most of the time it is a job.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jake finally joins the conversation, &quot;But you get to
live in a castle, right?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen and Daria roll their eyes.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jalura looks at Jake, &quot;Technically,
yes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is probably about 3 1/2 times
the size of this house.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are houses
in this town larger than the castle.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Heat comes from fireplaces.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There
is indoor plumbing, on the first floor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Historic landmarks are very hard to keep to standard Swiss housing
codes.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Oh.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen reclaims control of the conversation, &quot;So,
what do you think of America?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;It is nice.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I got to spend a couple of weeks with a cousin in San Francisco before
coming here.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;That's nice.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But, why here?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria is looking forward to hearing the answer to that
question.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura frowns, &quot;I cannot fully explain that to you
at this time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Suffice for now to say
that my country does have some industry and trade.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>A predatory glint appears in Helen's eyes.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;I see.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And the embassy has already retained legal counsel
here.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen, much less enthusiastically, replies, &quot;I
see.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What about your parents?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Daria said they aren't living here with
you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My
father ... is dead.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mother has to stay
home and be figurehead for the country.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
front step to Chez Duquesne<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>As Jalura turns up her walk, she is surprised to see
Jodie Landon waiting for her.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Hello, Jodie.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Hello.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I've
been waiting for you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Didn't Trinsch let you in?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;He offered, but I wanted to wait here.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I don't understand.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;What's up with you and Michael?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Ah, now I understand.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jalura sits down on the walk in front of
Jodie.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Don't get me wrong, he's very attractive.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Under many circumstances, I'd be interested
in dating him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But not these
circumstances.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And what is it about these circumstances that
should make me feel better?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;First and foremost, the fact that he loves you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;That wouldn't stop a lot of girls here.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;But it does stop me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have a firm rule that I will not knowingly
interfere in any non-abusive relationship.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jodie doesn't look fully convinced.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura continues, &quot;Second, putting aside the fact of
his feelings toward you, I really don't know how long I'll be able to stay
here.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It wouldn't be fair to him, or to
me, to start a relationship with someone and have to pack up and move.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, I guess I agree with that.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Jodie, I'm not trying to take Michael from
you.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jalura pauses, &quot;Has he
given any indication that he is interested in me?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, not really, but ...&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;'But' what?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;He likes the nickname you gave him.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, you've got to agree that 'MickMack' is better
than 'Mack Daddy.'&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;That isn't the point.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Then tell me what the point is.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;_I_ should be making nicknames for him.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I see.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Well,
what nickname would you give him?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jodie looks down, &quot;Umm, it’s kind of personal.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura's eyebrow cocks and loads, &quot;And would it be
in reference to a non-obvious physical attribute of his?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Jalura!&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But Jodie smiles as she exclaims.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;That's better; you're finally smiling.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Did you say that just to get me to smile?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;In part.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
have to admit to some curiosity.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jodie's eyebrow finally matches Jalura's &quot;Well,
you'll never pry the answer out of me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>No matter what you do.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Even if I set you up on a date with Charles
Ruttheimer, the Third?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jodie deliberately makes a Brittany-esque &quot;Eep&quot;
and laughs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;No, not that.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Anything but that!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I'll talk, I'll tell you everything!&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Ve have vays uv makink you tahk ....<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And I didn't even have to tickle you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Oh, no.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not
that.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Do you have any idea how ticklish
I am?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Jodie, that is not a very wise thing to say to
someone who has already threatened torture.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Both laugh for almost a minute.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jodie finally recovers, &quot;One more thing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That look you gave me in the pizza
place.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was like you could see into
me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I could.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You
need more laughter, more time with Michael, and less pressure from your parents
in your life.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Then you also know how impossible it is for me to
get those.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yeah.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
meant what I said about Michael, both about me not trying to take him from you
and how much you need him to help you keep your sanity with everything being
dumped on you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I'm really glad we had this talk, Jalura.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;So am I.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Now, before you go home, go see Michael.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Give him a great, big, sloppy wet kiss ... from you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jodie smiles broadly as she rises, &quot;Yes,
ma'am,&quot; and salutes as she heads down the walk.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura shakes her head as she opens the door, &quot;If
only all my problems could be solved that easily.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I wonder what nickname Jodie would give
Michael.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Part 5:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Friday<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mr.
DiMartino's class<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Stacy is in her usual seat, the furtive glances cast at
her are an exact replica of the pattern of glances at her empty seat yesterday.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Ms. Rowe.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
was told you'd be out for several days.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Stacy is clearly uncomfortable at being the center of
attention.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;I ... couldn't stand it
anymore.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I needed to come to
school.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Mr. DiMartino looks at her, and slowly nods his
head.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;See me briefly after class,
I'll tell you what you missed yesterday .... And, Stacy?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Everyone, including Stacy, notices that Mr. DiMartino
called Stacy by her first name.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Yes,
Mr. DiMartino?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>His expression is very much removed from his normal
eye-about-to-pop-out-of-its-socket-scowl and conveys depths of understanding
few would expect, &quot;Welcome back.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>A small, Mona Lisa smile crosses Jalura's face.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>the hall
outside Mr. DiMartino's class<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura grabs Sandi by the arm.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the voice of ice, &quot;One harsh word,
one dig, one smirk, and I break your jaw.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Get it?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Do you think that I --&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes, that's why I'm giving you warning.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If I didn't think you were intelligent enough
to heed it, I'd simply kill you here and now.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Sandi blanches, realizing that Jalura is being deadly
serious, and just plain deadly, &quot;Got it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Good.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Mr. O'Neill trembles slightly as he sees the expression
on Jalura's face.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Yes, Ms.
Duquesne?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I don't care what is on the syllabus.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We are not exploring Ophelia's motivations

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No 'buts.'<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Stacy has come back to school today and I don't want you giving her any
ideas about suicide.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Get it?&quot;<span

smallest touch of shape shifting to make her irises literally red for a moment.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Got it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Good.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now,
write me a hall pass so I won't be tardy for Ms. Barch's class.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura arrives before the bell rings, and will keep Mr.
O'Neill's _undated_ hall pass for ... future reference.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Stacy arrives just behind Jalura.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Ms. Barch stares at Stacy.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The bell rings.<o:p></o:p></p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Some women are strong enough to cope
with anything.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You could learn a lot
from Stacy's example.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;What?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What
happened to her is a perfect example of everything I've been saying about
men!&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What
happened to her is a perfect example of one sick man.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What happened to you is your own damn
fault.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can't blame all men for
either.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And what you are doing to the
men in this classroom is teaching them to repeat endlessly the cycle of power.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You want women to be treated equal to men;
you treat men with scrupulous equality.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That is the only way to break the cycle.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Besides, that perpetual scowl you wear makes you look ten years older
than you are.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;How dare you talk to me that way?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;How dare I not?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You want to blame men for Stacy, fine.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Be ignorant.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But know that you're
creating the next Mr. Rowe by the way you treat the men here.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The two stare at each other for a full minute.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ms. Barch finally drops the gaze.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I --&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I know.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;But, how could I be responsible for him leaving
me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;By being a selfish bitch on the one hand, and being
a stereotypical '50s housewife on the other.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Neither of those was a partner.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Do I have to treat men equally?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;If it's any consolation, you can continue to treat
Ruttheimer like the worthless ball of excrement that he is.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No, Linda, I'm not implying anything of the
sort.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen doodles as she listens to Linda Griffin on the
phone.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Linda, I really am not in a mood to pretend to put
up with you today.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And I don't care what
Sandi said, there will not be a Fashion Club meeting here today.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Stacy needs a chance to settle in.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen scratches out one doodle and begins another.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Linda, we don't get along.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We both know why we don't get along.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Quinn and Daria both approached me about having
Stacy stay with us, so this isn't our daughters fighting our battle for
us.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The new doodle is a bull's-eye drawn over a reasonable
likeness of Linda Griffin.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;This is about what's best for Stacy,&quot; Helen
yells into the phone, &quot;As far as I'm concerned, you and your stupid
daughter can both rot in Hell.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Helen slams the phone back onto the cradle, glad that she wasn't on the
cordless for that call.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Think calm thoughts, think calm thoughts.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Get it together, Morgendorffer.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>After a long moment, Helen is calm.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She looks at the clock, which reads 1:30.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen sighs, and heads toward the guest room to check it
for the fourth time today.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Once satisfied, she returns to the kitchen to check on
the dinner that is cooking in the oven.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;This is the last time I ever take a
three-and-a-half day weekend,&quot; Helen says to the roast as she bastes it.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Gym.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Hi, Stacy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>How are holding up with being in the spotlight all day?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I hate it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Still....<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It's better than
sitting at County Social Services all day.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Daria, I can't thank you enough for what your family is doing, letting
me stay with you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria smiles, &quot;If you want to pay _me_, beat up
Sandi.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Stacy slowly returns the smile, &quot;She's not _that_
bad.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Could have fooled me on that point.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Okay, she's a little self-centered, but in her own
way, she's a ... not-bad person.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I repeat.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Alright, so she thinks anyone who doesn't care
about fashion has a mental illness.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She
is right, though, that you'd be really pretty, maybe as pretty as Quinn, if
you'd just try.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria makes sure that Stacy can see the smile on Daria's
face before replying, &quot;I thought you wanted to stay at our house.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Stacy does see the smile, &quot;Okay.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I promise we won't try to give you a makeover
while I'm staying at your house.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Since when did you have that kind of power over
Sandi?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Stacy's smile broadens, &quot;Who said anything about
Sandi?&quot; and adds a look of innocence, &quot;I was just referring to Quinn
and myself.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria thinks to herself, &quot;There's more to this girl than
at first appears.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Besides, if you were suddenly competing with Quinn
on 'her' turf, it might inspire her do better in classes.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria turns to Jalura, who has just joined the
conversation, and Daria replies, &quot;And just whose side are you on?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Stacy looks worshipfully at Jalura.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura tries not to frown on seeing Stacy's expression,
and says to Daria, &quot;Well, mine, of course.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Didn't our conversation Wednesday night make that clear?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria isn't sure whether Jalura is joking or serious, but
before Daria can say anything, the bell rings and Ms. Morris begins class.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Today, we run.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Rowe, how's the ankle?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Better
than Wednesday?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes, ma'am, much better.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Okay, then out you go with the rest of them.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Duquesne, hold up a moment.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The majority of the girls head out, as Jalura wonders
what Ms. Morris wants.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes, Ms. Morris?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Ms. Morris waits until Stacy is out the door, then turns
to Jalura and asks, &quot;Will she be okay?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Once I figure out how to cure her of the hero
worship she's developed in regard to me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Maybe Daria's sister can help you with that.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Huh?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Before you came along, Quinn was Stacy's hero.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mostly because Quinn could hold her own with
Sandi.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Actually, I'm hoping that Daria will help with
that.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Daria?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She's
smart and all, but not really hero material.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Exactly.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Stacy doesn't need heroes, she needs friends.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And, Daria could use a few more friends
herself, especially if they're in the 'in' crowd.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Landon and MacKenzie are her friends, and I think
one of these breakups between Kevin and Brittany, the big moron will ask Daria
out.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;She'd kill him inside of twenty minutes.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And how would that be a bad thing?&quot; Ms. Morris
smiles at Jalura.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura chuckles, &quot;Okay, you've got me there.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Alright, go lap the other girls.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes, ma'am,&quot; and Jalura heads toward the door.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Ms. Morris calls to Jalura's back, &quot;And while you're
doing that, please reconsider the track team.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>the
Morgendorffer's house<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The County Social Services officer drops Stacy off and
departs once Stacy is safely inside.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Mrs. Morgendorffer, I can't thank you enough for
this.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You and Quinn and Daria have been
so nice to me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Stacy, I know that this is a very confusing time
for you.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We're just glad that we've got
a place for you to sort things out.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Thank you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Stop thanking me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>After a couple of days, you're going to have to eat one of my husband's
cooking experiments.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you still feel
grateful to us after that, you'll be just fine,&quot; and smiles at Stacy.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Quinn warned me about Mr. Morgendorffer's cooking,
but what I can smell from the kitchen smells really good.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;That's because I'm cooking tonight's dinner.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Although Jalura seemed just fine with Jake's
cooking last night.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Jalura was here?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Oh, wow.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen notices the look of reverence on Stacy's face.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mentally shrugging, and thinking that a
little bit of worship is only natural given that Jalura got Stacy out of her
situation, &quot;Yes, she has an interesting story for one so young.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I want to hear it, but from her ... if that's
okay.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen smiles indulgently, &quot;It is perfectly
alright.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I probably wouldn't do the
story justice anyway.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now, let's get you
unpacked.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen leads Stacy to the guest room.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The two unpack Stacy's suitcases, and Helen
wonders if this is a reverse-image of what it will be like to pack Quinn off to
college ... if she can get into a decent school with her current grades.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;My, you've brought a lot of stuff.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I hope that's okay.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I wasn't sure how long I'd be here, and --&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Of course its okay.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You'll need a lot of clothes and makeup to keep up with Quinn,&quot;
Helen is glad to see the look of relief on Stacy's face at Helen's reply.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Ummm, Stacy?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes, Mrs. Morgendorffer?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Linda Griffin called today.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Stacy's smile disappears.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Mrs. Morgendorffer, can I be honest with you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Of course you can, dear,&quot; turns to face Stacy,
and says, &quot;Lawyer-client confidentiality rules are in effect.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Stacy doesn't understand the joke, or the fact that Helen
actually isn't joking as she hopes to prosecute Stacy's father once he's
caught.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Stacy continues, &quot;I don't
like her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She's mean and bossy and
thinks she's better than everyone else in the world and she's not.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I know, dear.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I don't like her, either.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Stacy hugs Helen.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;Oh, I'm so glad to hear that, and that I'm getting to stay
here.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sandi tried to tell me to stay at
her house after Quinn and Daria said that
youofferedtoletmestayherebutIknowthatitwasjustaone-upsmanshipthingagainstQuinnand
....<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I'm babbling, aren't I?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;A little, but I understand.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Thank you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Anyway, I forbade Sandi from having any Fashion
Club meetings here this weekend.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You and
Quinn, and maybe Daria, are going to spend some quiet time here for a few
days.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Thank you, Mrs. Morgendorffer.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Like I said, I understand.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now, let's go check on dinner.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Quinn and Daria should be home any minute
now, and Mr. Morgendorffer in about forty minutes.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Outside
of Pizza King<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;You aren't welcome at our house until after
Monday.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;_You_ aren't even in the Fashion Club, Quinn's cousin,
so don't try to tell me when or where I can call a meeting.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Then I'll tell you, Sandi.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Don't come to our house this weekend.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are no Fashion Club meetings this
weekend.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Quinn, I don't recall you having been elected
President of the Fashion Club, but if I'm in error --&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria interrupts, &quot;Oh, you're in error all
right.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you try to barge into our
house, I'll beat the attitude right out of you, if Mom doesn't do it
first.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Besides, even if I'm not a member
of your worthless little club, I know that Quinn would be a hell of a lot
better at running it than you ... and that if you put leadership of the Club to
a vote, you'd lose.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So don't press your
luck on either front.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And, I'm the only
person who could get Her Grace, Princess Jalura, to deign to join the Club, so
don't give me any more of your lip, Sandi.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I don't have to listen to a loser like you!&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Maybe you'll listen to me, you stuck-up, worthless
little snot!&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Sandi wheels around to see Jodie Landon in front of a
dozen of their popular female classmates, including Brooke and Brittany.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All look as if they are prepared to do
serious business.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jodie continues,
&quot;We're all sick of you, and Daria just happened to be the one who won the
lottery for who gets to beat the stuffing out of you if you get out of line one
more time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>_If_ you remember, I was made
a standing offer to join the Fashion Club.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If I exercised that offer right now, my first action would be to declare
the presidency vacant, then I'd nominate Quinn for the position and she'd win
four votes to one as Tiffany -- in her Machiavellian little way -- would vote
with the majority.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then I'd move to
expel you from the club, and since you wouldn't have a vote against your own
expulsion, that motion would unanimously carry.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Then you'd have nothing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now, I
believe Daria told you to stay the hell away from her house this weekend.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Sandi, realizing that she is outnumbered fifteen to one,
runs away before anyone can see the tears forming in her eyes.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Quinn looks at Sandi's retreating back, shakes her head
and sighs sadly, and says, &quot;Come on, Sis.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Let's go home.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Stacy should be
there by now.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And we wouldn't want to leave her alone with Mom
for too long.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Agreed.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Lawndale
Park<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Sandi fights back the tears and curses her fate.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;It's all Quinn's fault.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She's always wanted to take the Fashion Club
away from me.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Paces.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;No, it is her _sister's_ fault.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She hates everything the Fashion Club stands
for, and is trying to tear it apart.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Chez
Duquesne<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Sandi throws a Molotov cocktail through the front window
and waits, pistol in hand, for Jalura to come out.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Sandi is very confused when the flames appear to
extinguish after only a few seconds.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The front door opens and Jalura is framed in the doorway.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Sandi raises her father's pistol, and screams, &quot;I
rule this town, &lt;mock reverent&gt;Princess!&lt;/mock reverent&gt;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura gestures, almost casually, with one hand, and
Sandi disappears.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Several gunshots are heard.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura reverses her hand gesture, and Sandi
reappears.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Smoke is streaming from the
barrel of the gun.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sandi is holding the
trigger down, but no more bullets emerge.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Go home.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;What the Hell did you do?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;An object lesson.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You aren't capable of harming me against my will.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You are merely mortal.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I am, to the best of your ability to
understand, a goddess.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Annoy me again,
and you go to a place from which you don't come back, ever.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I'll kill you!&quot; and Sandi charges the door
wielding the pistol as a blunt object.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura gestures again, and Sandi again disappears.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is a faint sound of Sandi's final
scream as she fades out.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I warned you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura closes the door.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Dad, what are you doing here?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Excuse me, Miss?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Come on, Dad, what's with the joke?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You've finally come to listen to Trent
play?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And Jalura, how did you find
him?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Ummm, Jane, this is Trinsch.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jane looks at Trinsch, her jaw literally drops.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Miss Jane, why did you call me 'Dad?'&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, Jethro, you look just like my Dad,&quot; as
Jane reaches for her wallet to pull out a picture of her family.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;My name is Trinsch, not Jethro.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura laughs, getting Jane's joke after a moment,
&quot;I'll explain later, Trinsch.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thank
you, Jane; I needed a good laugh after this afternoon.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jane finds the photo and offers it to Trinsch as she
looks at Jalura, &quot;What happened this afternoon?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;How much did Daria tell you about me?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The amusement is gone from Jane's face,
&quot;Amber.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Okay, then.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Jalura leans close to Jane, and whispers, &quot;I had to put Sandi down
this afternoon.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jane whispers back, &quot;'Put down,' as in publicly
humiliate, or 'put down' as in dogs?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;The latter.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>She tried to kill me this afternoon.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Why?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I don't know and I don't care.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She tried to burn my house down and shoot me
with a pistol.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Under current
circumstances, I had neither the time, nor the patience, nor extra compassion
to deal with her in a way that would leave her alive ... and I gave her a chance
to walk away before it got to that level.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Ding, dong; the witch is dead.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Keep it to yourself for now.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let people think she ran away.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Or maybe, I'll bring her body back and
deposit it conveniently close to Mr. Rowe once he's been located.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let her death do some good and help put that
sick man away for a long time.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Jalura, I do look a great deal like her
father,&quot; Trinsch says, as he hands the photo back to Jane.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;This could have its advantages.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;We'll see.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
have a feeling things are going to come to a head very quickly.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I'm not sure if I want to agree with you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Understood.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Jalura looks up at the stage, Mystik Spiral is about to begin.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>the
Morgendorffer's house, Quinn's bedroom, after dinner<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I don't know, Stacy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I could just blackmail Quinn with the photo I
took of her as she was waking up last Sunday morning, if she doesn't feel bound
by your promise.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Quinn's eyes flare wide, &quot;You wouldn't!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Would you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;After this afternoon, no.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Stacy asks, &quot;What happened this afternoon?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Quinn and I, and a baker's dozen of the popular
people not in the Fashion Club had a little heart-to-heartless with
Sandi.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Daria, it was more like the Showdown at the O.K.
Corral!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And you were doing a mean Billie
Holliday.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;That's Doc Holliday.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And nobody died.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Sandi sure looked like she wanted to, though.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Tell me all about it!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ooh, I wish I could have been there to see
it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria relates the scene from the Pizza King with several
interruptions from Quinn.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Zen<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Excuse me for a minute; I want to tell Trent how
much I like the new sound.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also, I need
to use the facilities.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Okay.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jane turns to Trinsch, &quot;You know, you really could
pass for my father.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe you could get
me out of some classes next week.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Miss Jane, that would involve me speaking to Ms.
Li.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even if she hasn't already imprinted
my voice from my berating her over the phone, I would consider talking to her
in person hazardous duty, and my services don't come cheap.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;So how much do you get for being her
bodyguard?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I'm giving Martin a very special rate on this
service, but roughly fifty ounces of gold per day.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Fifty 'ounces' of gold?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Per day?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I told you my services don't come cheap.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, Jethro, you were sure right about that.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Since she hasn't explained, maybe you'd care to let
me in on the joke?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I knew Sandi would be able to force a meeting at
the Morgendorffer's.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I'd better start
preparing the guest room for Stacy.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;So, don't you have a date tonight, Quinn?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, I kind of did, but I'd rather be here.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Stacy looks as if she's about to become uncomfortable as the
center of attention.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;You really
didn't need to cancel any plans on my account, Quinn.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Stacy, you're my friend.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Think of this as an extended sleepover,&quot;
as Quinn gestures dismissively with her hand.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And as a bonus, a three day vacation from Sandi.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Daria's right.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We've earned it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Stacy still doesn't look convinced.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And what about you, Daria?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Did you have any plans for this
evening?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Not really.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Trent's band is doing its usual Friday night gig at the Zen, but there's
a finite limit to the number of times I can hear 'Icebox Woman' without running
screaming into the night.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I probably
would have stayed home tonight and read or done homework.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I've never been to the Zen.<span

again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Seems that one of The Harpies has

gross, Daria.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Zen<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Hey, we're Mystik Spiral.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Various noises come from the crowd, with appreciative
ones mildly beating out derisive ones.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Before we do our second set, we want you to meet
the person responsible for our new sound.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Jalura, come on up here.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>On seeing Jalura as she takes the stage, the appreciative
noises, especially from the males, definitely overpower the derisive noises.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Thank you.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Trent has asked me to play a song.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But I told him it'd be your choice whether or not I played.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The appreciative noises are all that can be heard now.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Okay, I can take a hint.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jalura smiles, and picks up Trent's acoustic
guitar, &quot;Give me a second while I put this in an open-D tuning for
this.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jalura adjusts the strings
as if by sight alone, strums once, nods with an air of satisfaction.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Hey, Trinsch, bring me a barstool.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I want to sit while I play.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Trinsch leaves Jane, taking his stool with him to the
front.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>As he reaches the stage, Jane notices a man with an odd
complexion and an orange Mohawk and wearing a leather jacket standing near
her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He seems out of place, although
Jane can't quite put her finger on why.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Back on the stage, Jalura takes the stool and gets
ready.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Alright.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is a song from where I come from.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is called, 'Shadows of My Home.'&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;She's pretty good, huh?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yeah, the lyrics remind me of Hungarian folk music,
but the cadence is almost Languedoc French.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Interesting blend.&quot; <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Wow, how'd you learn so much about music?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Doctoral candidate in Music Theory at the state

about them.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Looks at the stage,
&quot;I think they're talking her into another song.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;You blame them?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Not a bit.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Mohawk Man is correct.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Trent, and the crowd, is convincing Jalura to sing another song.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After a moment, she puts down the acoustic
guitar and directs Trent to pick up his guitar.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Once in position, Jalura gently grasps the arm of, and whispers
something to, each band member in turn.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Jalura then turns to the audience and steps up to the microphone.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Anyone here from Minnesota?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>No one responds in the affirmative.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;That's too bad, because there are a lot of great
bands up there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One that has kind of
broken up, even if most of its members are still in the music business, called

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria is typing into the electronic copy of her journal.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;What a week it has been!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I suddenly discover that I exist because a god
needed a friend, and chose me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No longer
will I be able to hide behind my glasses, my books or my attitude:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>she has challenged me to accept a guardian's
role toward the human race, and I have accepted the challenge.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As if that isn't shocking enough, I find that
my sister may actually be my friend, as well.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>At the very least, we have found a common goal in helping a classmate,
Stacy Rowe, through a very difficult time in her life, and a common enemy in
Sandi Griffin.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Don't disregard the
previous entries on Stacy and Quinn, but accept that there'll probably be some
significant updates in the near future.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;About this god, Jalura.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She is more along the lines of one of the
Greek gods than anything experiencing large-scale worship today.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Flawed and far more human than either my
father's Judaic monoform God or my mother's Episcopal triune Deity, Jalura is a
god you actually can talk to ... and she's got a pretty good sense of humor, to
boot.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If she had an owl hanging around,
the obvious comparison would be to Athena.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;But, she's also got enemies.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Her pantheon is fractured and fractious.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is one of her kind who is actively out
to kill her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And if she's not careful,
he could succeed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even if he fails, a
fight here could cost a lot of lives.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
don't call these beings gods without good reason; they are powerful enough to
create whole worlds for their amusement or armament at a whim, and probably can
destroy them as easily.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes, I do care about people.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you've read this far, you know that I
always have.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I still think most of them
are stupid too often, but maybe that's what makes them -- I mean, us -- human.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I know these few words won't satisfy the curious
reader, but I'm still getting used to openly expressing my emotions and need to
sort through all of this before I can elaborate.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Trinsch.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Long time, no see.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Hey, boss.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Nice hair.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Does Jalura know
you're here?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No, and I'd like it to stay that way.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She needs to fight this one herself if she's
ever going to get over her hero worship of me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Understood.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>She's done pretty well so far.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Here, take this,&quot; as Mohawk Man hands Trinsch
a sketch of Jane Lane.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Despite
apparently only having moments to compose it, the work contains eight colors of
ink, and the rather complete picture somehow puts Jane in front of an easel.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Nice work.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How'd
you know she's an artist?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Martin shrugs, &quot;I can tell.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>With training, she could even make basic
trumps.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;You don't say?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I was tempted to put the easel facing toward the
viewer, but I didn't want to make this a recursive Trump.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Huh.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You know,
Jalura called Dworkin asking about Mandelbrot Shadows the other day.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Really?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Twisted minds think alike, I guess.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Has there been any trouble?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Dalt knows where she is.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He managed to hit her with a latent tracking
spell some time ago.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She thinks it'll
take a Pattern-walk to clear it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Good for what ails you.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Any combat?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;One fire angel.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Ah, that would explain where the other one
went.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Its mate recently attacked Merlin
and/or Rinaldo in an 'Alice in Wonderland' Shadow.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Rinaldo?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As
in little Rinny, a.k.a. Prince Rinaldo of Kashfa?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And as in the son of Brand.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Lore must be spitting fuchsia.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;He was, until he discovered that he's older than
Rinaldo, independent of Shadow time.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Interesting.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>So what brings Merlin and the stuck-up, worthless little snot
together?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;A long story, the full version of which I have not
yet heard.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Merlin didn't have a whole
lot of time to talk to me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But
apparently Rinaldo is no longer to be considered an enemy.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;We didn't think you'd be in contact for several
days yet.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Merlin's also got Chaos Trumps.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He called in some favors in The Courts to get
a message delivered to me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And things
were done where I was, so I took a double-jump back, and then arrived
here.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;How did you get through the security net?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;There's a small glitch that I was able to
exploit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I used raw Magick, rather than
Trump or Shadow-shifting.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I'll have to fix that fast.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Then off you go.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>And tell Jalura's friend not to say anything.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes, Jethro?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Don't tell Jalura about the man you spoke to.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Why not?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There's something about him --&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Something regal, yet hidden?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Oh.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Jalura's been itching to talk to him.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She should know.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This
fight is hers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She has to do it with no
more than my help.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Why?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Because if he fights Dalt for her, she'll never
become independent.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Could have fooled me on that point.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;You've not seen her around him.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Hero worship?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes, Jethro?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;How did you sleep, Stacy?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Okay, I guess.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen looks at Stacy, who looks as if she hasn't slept
for a week.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Really?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I never could sleep well in a new place.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Plus, I didn't exactly buy the most
comfortable bed for that room,&quot; leans in and whispers to Stacy, &quot;You
see, I was always afraid that Jake's mother would try to stay for an extended
visit and I wanted to subtly dissuade her by making the room as little to her liking
as I could do.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;So that explains the closet.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, no.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It
actually came that way.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But that is why
we made that room the guest room.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Stacy giggles.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;The room is fine, Mrs. Morgendorffer.<span

up?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Daria will probably be down soon.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Quinn won't put in an appearance until she's
put her face together.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I've seen what she looks like before she can put it
back together.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And Daria's taken photos
of it, though she says she won't use them for blackmail anymore.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Anymore?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;They didn't tell you about yesterday?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No, they didn't.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>What happened?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Quinn and I did a tag-team off-telling of Sandi ...
with a little help from Jodie and everyone who's been kept out of the Fashion
Club by Sandi's arrogance.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Daria, I didn't hear you come down.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria, still in her sleepwear, goes to the refrigerator
and pours a large glass of orange juice before speaking.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;I came down to check on Stacy, only to
find myself being talked about behind my back.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Stacy and Helen are both ready to apologize until they
see the Mona Lisa smile on Daria's face.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Daria continues as she puts two toaster pastries in the toaster,
&quot;But, as rumors have to go, this is one for which the spreading of it
won't annoy me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;So you and Quinn are working together, now?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Does this mean I won't have to keep you on
opposite sides of the table at dinner anymore?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And have you and Dad playing 'footsie' under the
table?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No way.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We're keeping you two apart, not you keeping
us apart.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Now, Daria --&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Mom, I still remember the time you _missed_ Dad's
leg.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ewwwwww.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Daria!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We
have a guest!&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria replies, deadpan, &quot;Who's going to be with us
for some time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She's going to get to see
that probably every family is dysfunctional in one way or another,&quot; 'pop'
goes the toaster and Daria gingerly picks up her breakfast and heads toward the
table.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Or, at least, has its
quirks.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Stacy can not believe the casual friendly teasing banter
between Daria and Helen, and doesn't realize that it is something quite new,
something that wouldn't have been present a week ago.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Stacy decides to try her hand at entering the
game, and puts on her best innocent look, &quot;Thanks, Daria.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I thought everyone but I lived in a perfect
fairy-tale castle, but that image of your mother playing footsie has
permanently shattered my childhood innocence.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria's eyebrow raises, then she covers her mouth with
her hand as she starts to laugh.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Stacy immediately follows Daria into laughter.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen, momentarily distracted by the irony of Stacy's
words given what she's been through, is slower to join in.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But as she does, she thinks to herself,
&quot;Already she can make jokes about it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There's more to this girl than at first appears.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>a phone
booth near the parking lot of a motel, some 200 miles from Lawndale.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The rear end of a brown sedan lowers a bit, as if a large
weight has been added to the trunk.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;May you in death do more of good than you ever did
in life.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let your soul's torments end,
Alexandra Griffin.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura looks out and gestures with her hand, and 'pop'
goes the distributor cap as it breaks under the hood of the brown sedan.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Thanks, Merle, for the auto repair
lesson.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Picking up the receiver, Jalura dials 911.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Police?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Yes, it is an emergency.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Holds for a moment, “Oh, thank you.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Officer, I saw him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That horrible
man from Lawndale, the one who was on TV last night....<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Yes, that one.... He's at the Highwayman Inn
on Route 6.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You'd better hurry.... no,
I'm safe here, but I can see his car in the parking lot.... No, that's not
necessary.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You just make him pay for
what he did to that innocent little girl.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That's all the reward I need.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Jalura hangs up the phone and vanishes.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No, where is she anyway?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;At the Morgendorffer's.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Helen and Quinn are trying to control poor
Stacy's recovery.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sandi is making sure
that Stacy will come here where things will be much better for the girl.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sandi had to stay there overnight to help
Stacy figure out what is in her best interest.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Tom grunts, being unwilling to argue with his wife, but
doubting that this house would be a good place to recover from anything ...
including the hangover he is nursing at the moment.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura and a man face each other from each edge of the
scorch mark from the fire angel's demise.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The man is has his sand-colored hair pulled back in a ponytail and he
has on the tans and light browns of a man accustomed to the forest.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is clear that the two are related.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Alright, Dalt.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This ends now.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You have one
chance to walk away.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Brave words from a foolish girl.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Bravery and foolishness are the same actions taken
heartbeats apart.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Then prepare for your heart to beat its last.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;You know, Dalt, where we last fought ... there is a
race of beings called Klingons.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They
have a saying, &lt;Heghlu'meH QaQ jajvam&gt; which means, 'It is a good day to
die.'<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Try saying it, because this is
your one chance for it not to come true ... walk away now.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Hah, you and what army?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I thought about an army, but I decided I don't need
one to deal with you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Definitely foolish.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Dalt draws a sword and takes a step
forward.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then screams in agony as he
disappears.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;You can get out of there eventually, Dalt.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Bet those bullets hurt, though.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When you do get out, don't ever come after me
again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Next time I'll send you someplace
from which you won't return, at least not alive.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jalura pulls out a match, lights it, and sets
on fire the piece of origami work that she reveals to have been held in her
left hand.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Mrs. Griffin?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes, how may I help you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;May I come in, please?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;What is this about?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Your daughter, ma'am.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>May I come in please?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Linda steps aside to let the officer enter.<span

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>the
Morgendorffer's house<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen Morgendorffer opens the door.<span

her step.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Mrs. Morgendorffer?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes, how may I help you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Is Stacy Rowe here?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;May I come in, please?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Of course,&quot; turns toward the stairs as she
makes room for the officer to enter, &quot;Stacy, the police are here and need
to talk to you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Okay, I'll be down in a second.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Stacy comes down the stairs, followed closely by Quinn
and Daria.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Ms. Rowe, I'm Detective Claire Davis.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Please have a seat.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;What is it?&quot; as Stacy sits on the couch.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Your father is in custody.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He's been found and apprehended.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen is the first to speak, &quot;Oh, thank God.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Quinn puts her hand on Stacy's shoulder, &quot;This'll
soon be over.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria adds, &quot;They probably need to make sure you'll
be willing to testify against him.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I'm afraid there's more to it than that.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Are you two Quinn and Daria
Morgendorffer?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Quinn nods, and Daria becomes alert as she asks,
&quot;Why do you want to know?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Detective Davis pauses, chews her lower lip, then says,
&quot;There's more to it than just having found Mr. Rowe.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The body of a young woman was found in the
trunk of his car when he was arrested, a Ms. Alexandra Griffin.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Stacy whimpers, and then begins to cry.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Quinn is the first to speak, &quot;Oh, my God.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Ms. Morgendorffer, and Ms. Morgendorffer, I
understand that you had an altercation with Ms. Griffin yesterday.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen interrupts, &quot;Just a minute, Officer.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can't just question my daughters like
that.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;It is 'Detective,' ma'am.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And they aren't suspects.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We're quite certain that Mr. Rowe caused MS.
Griffin's death, but we're trying to determine how Ms. Griffin came into
contact with him.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;It's alright, Mom.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Yes, Detective.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Quinn and I had a
verbal altercation with Sandi yesterday.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You are, no doubt, aware of recent events involving Ms. Rowe, and Ms.
Griffin was upset that Ms. Rowe was staying here rather than at the Griffin
residence.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ms. Griffin, in her own
self-centered way, was trying to help Stacy here with some semblance of normalcy
by scheduling a meeting of the Lawndale High Fashion Club, in which Sandi,
Stacy and Quinn are all members, at our home for last night.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Our mother had expressly prohibited visitors
until Monday, to give Stacy a chance to get settled in here.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When Quinn and I heard about Sandi's
intention, we confronted her and forbade her from coming to our house.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>During the discussion, several other students
from Lawndale High expressed support for our position against Sandi.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sandi ran off, toward her house, and that's
the last I time I saw her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Quinn,
anything to add to that?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No, that was the last I saw of her, too.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She didn't call over here last night,
either.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Okay, that sounds pretty much like the version of
the story everyone has told so far.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What
the hell got into that girl?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I don't know, Detective,&quot; as Daria shakes her
head.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Is there anything
else?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Just one more question, if I may.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was told that a Ms. Jalura Duquesne had a
verbal altercation with Ms. Griffin earlier in the week ... was Ms. Duquesne
among those involved in yesterday's confrontation?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No, she wasn't.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>She was mentioned briefly during the discussion, but she wasn't
there.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Detective Davis rises, and heads toward the door.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Thank you, you've been very
cooperative.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I don't think I'll need to
do any follow up with either of you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Four women watch the detective leave; no one says
anything as the door closes.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Chez
Duquesne<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura opens the door.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>She is wearing a robe and has her hair in a towel; it looks as if she
had recently stepped out of the shower.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>She appears surprised to find a police officer on her step.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Ms. Jalura Duquesne?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes, how may I help you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;May I come in, please?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Of course,&quot; and Jalura shows Detective Davis
to the sofa.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Ms. Duquesne, Mr. Rowe has been apprehended this
morning.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Oh, that's great news.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Does Stacy know?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes, Ms., I just came from the Morgendorffer
residence.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;This will really help Stacy's recovery, not to have
to live in fear of him anymore.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I'm afraid there's more to the story.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Huh?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;The body of a Ms. Alexandra Griffin was found in
the trunk of Mr. Rowe's car.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Oh, my.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Body, as in ...?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes,&quot; Detective Davis chews her lip, &quot;I
need to ask you a couple of questions, please.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Of course, officer.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;It's 'Detective,' actually.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ms. Duquesne, when was the last time you saw
Ms. Griffin alive.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jalura thinks for a moment, then says, &quot;Economics
class, just before lunch yesterday.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And did she say anything to you, or you to
her?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Not then, the last I spoke to her was just after
first period.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And what did you talk to her about?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, you see, none of us expected Stacy back in
school so soon.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sandi ... there's no
polite way to say it, is an arrogant little brat who treats Stacy like
dirt.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I told Sandi in no uncertain terms
that I wasn't going to put up with any action by Sandi that would upset
Stacy.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And when you say 'no uncertain terms,' what do you
mean?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Ummm, I kind of threatened to break her jaw.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;You do realize that, technically speaking, that is
a crime?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes, ma'am.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, I'll just put down that you and Sandi
exchanged words about how to deal with Stacy's presence.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Thank you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Don't mention it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I mean that literally.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I think I understand.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Does Stacy know about Sandi?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes, she was quite upset.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Damn.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I wish
Helen hadn't forbidden visitors the whole weekend.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Though maybe this is for the best.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;You see, Stacy was showing a bit of hero worship
toward me for being the person who set in motion what got her out of her
situation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe if I'm not there now,
that worship won't intensify, and she'll be all right on her own a lot sooner
than she otherwise would.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Detective Davis considers this, &quot;That makes
sense.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I hope you're right.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;So do I.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, your story runs with everyone else's so I
think that's it as far as you need be concerned until Mr. Rowe's
trial.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Detective Davis rises.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Thank you, Detective.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jalura rises and escorts the police officer
to the door.<o:p></o:p></p>

DiMartino's freshman American History class<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>A few glances are cast toward Sandi's empty chair.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;All right, students.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I know that many of you are upset about Ms.
Griffin's passing, but this is a school and there are a finite number of times
in a semester we can deviate from the syllabus.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Ms. Rowe, based on the readings, what was Washington's primary military
tactic against the British?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Ummm, tactical retreat to extend supply lines so
that raids could deplete British supplies and morale?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Mr. DiMartino and Jalura both offer Mona Lisa smiles.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
hallway near Daria's locker<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;So, what's the big deal with us going to dinner at
Jalura's house?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I don't know, Jane.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But she said we need to meet her here after class.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jane leans in and whispers, &quot;Daria, there's
something I didn't tell you about Sandi.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria looks at her best friend and whispers back, &quot;I
know.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jalura told me about it
earlier.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Are you sure we can trust her?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jane pauses, then leans back and returns to normal voice,
&quot;Well, then, where is she?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She's
late.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I am not; I just had to get my stuff.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Daria and Jane turn to face Jalura, who walks
up to them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Ready to go?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yep.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;All set.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Good, let's go, then.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The three head out of the building and down the street.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;So, I was asking Daria, what's the big deal about
having dinner at your house?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Not my house, Jane.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>My home.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Home?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You
mean ....&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I mean.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hang
on for the ride of your lives, ladies.&quot;</p>
