"I don&#8217;t <i>believe</i>
this!" cried Daria Morgendorffer with uncharacteristic heat. She was at
her best friend Jane Lane&#8217;s house, watching TV. Normally at this time
of day she&#8217;d be watching <i>Sick, Sad World</i> on MTV, reveling in
the misfits and freaks who were her (fortunately) as yet unmet peers.
But today her usual trashy tabloid show had been pre-empted for a one
hour pilot so sick that not even Daria could stomach it.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"It&#8217;s <i>The Beavis and Butthead Show</i>!" an off-camera announcer crooned as the theme began to play. It looked like a cheesy rip-off of that old cop show, <i>Starsky &amp; Hutch</i>.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"How did those two idiots get a TV show!" Daria demanded to the television. The television ignored her, as usual.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Jane on the other hand
was more than willing to put her two cents worth in. "Well, you know
how MTV is. Tom Freston and his cronies probably got together and said,
&#8216;hmm&#8230; we&#8217;re not meeting our violence and stupidity quota for the year.
Why don&#8217;t we get two inbreeds from Texas with a mile long criminal
record? That&#8217;ll bring in the ratings.&#8217;"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"At least I&#8217;m not part of it," said Daria.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"&#8230;and co-starring Tracy Grandstaff as Daria Morgendorffer!" said the announcer, as if on cue.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">A flicker of disbelief
crossed Daria&#8217;s normally expressionless face. "Do me a favor," she said
to Jane. "Go into the kitchen and get me a knife. A nice, sharp knife."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Sorry. No can do. You still owe me five bucks."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Daria turned off the TV,
eager to get Highland&#8217;s Prodigal Sons out of her sight. As she watched
Jane work on her latest masterpiece, something occurred to her.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Jane, nearly every time I come over, you&#8217;re working on a painting. What happens to them when they&#8217;re finished?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"I sell them."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Okay. Now where do they really go?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"No, really. I can get about thirty bucks from local diners for my paintings. <i>Mom&#8217;s</i> bought my neo-Goya for forty-five."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"You sell them to <i>diners?"</i> asked Daria incredulously.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"And the Leeville Museum
of Modern and Post-Modern Art. They&#8217;ve got this section for juvenile
artists. They want to catch us while we&#8217;re young," Jane noted cynically.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"And how much do <i>they</i> pay you?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"They&#8217;re my best customers. I can squeeze about fifty out of them."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"I always wondered where you got your money for pizza. You don&#8217;t have anyone to blackmail like me."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Jane shrugged. "Well, I have to have <i>some</i> way of paying the mortgage when my parents go off on their spiritual quests," she said modestly.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Just then the phone rang.
"I wonder who that could be," Jane said as she walked over to the
phone. "Only one person ever calls me and she&#8217;s right here."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Jane picked up the phone.
"Hello? &#8230;Well speak of the devil! &#8230;That sounds great! &#8230;Oh. &#8230;I see. &#8230;I
see. &#8230;Look, is there some way you could forego that part of it? &#8230;No?
&#8230;Okay, maybe it won&#8217;t be that painful after all. &#8230;Hey, at least I miss
a school day, right? &#8230;Okay, bye." Jane replaced the receiver.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Who was that?" asked Daria. Jane seldom went from depression to jubilation and back again in the span of a phone call.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"That was the museum&#8217;s
junior curator. &#8216;Due to my outstanding achievements and contributions
as an artist to the Museum of Modern and Post-Modern Art, the museum
has graciously bestowed upon me my own exhibition room, as a token of
their gratitude.&#8217; The Jane Lane Room."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"That&#8217;s you, all right," said Daria sarcastically. "The most outstanding achiever I know. What&#8217;s the <i>real</i> reason?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"My paintings were taking up too much space in the juvenile wing. Wait, it gets worse."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"How so?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"They&#8217;re holding a
dedication ceremony in my honor, and I have to make a little speech.
Right in front of all those artsy types."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"And you want me to write the speech for you."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Well, if you&#8217;re offering&#8230;"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"No."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Come on," whined Jane.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"I don&#8217;t care. You&#8217;re not going to break me with your sonic torture devices either. I live with Quinn, remember?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Come on," Jane whined again. "It&#8217;s not the hardest speech in the world to write, you know."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Then why don&#8217;t you write it?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Because you&#8217;re the best writer I know, and this is a special occasion."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Flattery will get you everywhere."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Really?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"No, it was the whining."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Tell you what, I&#8217;ll even forget about the five bucks."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Then can I please have that knife now?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Nope. Blood leaves stains on the carpet. Hey, how bad can it be? No one ever watches <i>Sick, Sad World</i> at school. They probably don&#8217;t even know Beavis and Butthead exist."</font></p><p>
</p><hr noshade="noshade">
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">That night at dinner,
Daria recounted what she had seen on television to her family. Helen
listened, leaning toward her daughter and fingers steepled with
interest. "Well, now. Who would have thought those two would get a
television show?"</font><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Then the worst part is
that they have a likeness of me on the show. And the woman doesn&#8217;t look
a thing like me! It&#8217;s enough to make you wish they&#8217;d outlawed
inbreeding. Wait, they already did that."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"You really feel strongly about this, don&#8217;t you Daria?" said Helen.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"How could you tell?" asked Daria sardonically.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Well&#8230; you&#8217;re talking to us."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Daria shrugged.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"I&#8217;m sure we can at least get them for Defamation of Character."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Mom," interrupted Daria,
"those two are so stupid, they&#8217;re probably not even getting paid. The
producers are probably taking all of the money."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Across from Daria, Quinn was busy dialing the phone. "Quinn, honey, who are you calling?" asked Helen.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Beavis and Butthead. With any luck, I can get a guest appearance on the show," replied Quinn.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"I had hoped that you would be more supportive of your sister in this matter," said Helen.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Muh-<i>om</i>," whined
Quinn, "I want to be on TV." Then she spoke into the receiver. "Hello,
MTV? May I please speak to Beavis and Butthead? &#8230;Tell them it&#8217;s
Daria&#8217;s, I mean <i>Diarrhea&#8217;s</i> sister."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"I always wondered why she was so anal," quipped Daria.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"&#8230;Yes, they&#8217;ll know what I mean. &#8230;Thank you." Quinn waited patiently for a few minutes. "<i>Hi</i>
Beavis! &#8230;You remember me, don&#8217;t you? &#8230;It&#8217;s Quinn, Diarrhea&#8217;s sister.
&#8230;Uh-huh &#8230;So how are things in Texas? &#8230;You set Anderson&#8217;s house on
fire?" Quinn laughed nervously. "Huh-huh, that&#8217;s cool," she imitated
Butthead. "&#8230;So listen, I was wondering, since I&#8217;m Diarrhea&#8217;s sister,
can I come down and do a show with you guys? &#8230;What? EEEEWWWWWW!" She
hung up the phone.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"What did he say?" asked Helen.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"He said he&#8217;d fly me down to do the show if he could score with me," replied Quinn.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"So when are you going?" asked Daria sarcastically.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Across from Helen, Jake
slammed down the newspaper and stood up like a rocket being shot into
space. "What? No daughter of mine is going to sell her body just so she
can be on some trashy television program!"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Jake, sit down," said Helen. "She isn&#8217;t going to do the show."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"<i>Oh&#8230;"</i> began Jake
sarcastically. Then Helen&#8217;s statement finally registered on Jake&#8217;s
brain. "Oh," he said with understanding, taking his seat at the dinner
table.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Right, Dad," said Quinn. "No television show is worth <i>that</i>."</font></p><p>
</p><hr noshade="noshade">
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"So much for Quinn&#8217;s
acting career," laughed Jane after Daria had retold the events of last
night at school. The two were walking to art class, and Jane was
looking forward to incorporating today&#8217;s lesson into another painting.
Daria also enjoyed art: the teacher, Ms. Defoe, was actually normal;
and Daria&#8217;s drawings were often great inspirations for stories and
essays in English class.</font><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"That&#8217;s good enough for me," said Daria. "I don&#8217;t want any more connection with those two idiots than I already have."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"You know, Daria, anyone else would kill to be in a TV show."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Not me. I wasn&#8217;t meant to be on television."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Yeah," agreed Jane, "you&#8217;re one of those girls you base a series of teen novellas on, right?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Daria shrugged. "Assuming I wasn&#8217;t too boring to write about, yeah."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Just then a familiar chant came from down the hall. "DIARRHEA-CHA-CHA-CHA! DIARRHEA-CHA-CHA-CHA!"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Daria looked down the
hallway and then sighed, simultaneously relieved and annoyed to find
Kevin Thompson at the source of the chants. He was still chanting with
fervor as Daria and Jane approached him and his girlfriend, Brittany
Taylor.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"No one at school would be watching, huh?" Daria growled at Jane.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Well what do you want?" replied Jane. "It&#8217;s hard to think down to their level."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Hey, Daria," greeted Kevin. "I mean &#8216;Diarrhea&#8217;."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Wow, Daria," squeaked Brittany. "You&#8217;re famous. That woman who plays you sounds exactly like you!"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Yeah. DIARRHEA-CHA-CHA&#8230;" Kevin broke off as Brittany elbowed him in the stomach. She lowered her voice to a whisper.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"I wish he&#8217;d stop that. He sounds <i>so</i> stupid."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"You noticed?" remarked Jane.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Look, Kevin," Daria began, "I&#8217;d appreciate it if you wouldn&#8217;t call me that. It gets on my nerves."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Sure thing Dia&#8230; Daria."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"And let&#8217;s just keep this our little secret, okay?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"What are you talking about?" asked Kevin. "It&#8217;s all over school."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Daria sighed and rested her head on a nearby locker. Then she began to bang her head against it repeatedly.</font></p><p>
</p><hr noshade="noshade">
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">By the time they had
gotten to art class, things had gotten better. Kevin&#8217;s chanting had
dribbled off into Freudian slips, and Jane was telling Daria about her
problems, which always seemed to take her mind off of her own. "&#8230;so I
had to go to the office to get Ms. Li to excuse me from school for the
dedication ceremony."</font><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"And if you&#8217;re not back in forty-eight hours, she calls out the bloodhounds."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"No, she seemed content enough. And <i>that</i> is what worries me."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Sounds like we&#8217;re going to have to keep an ear out for morning announcements."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Morning announcements
came just before art class, and told about school sports results and
school sponsored events. The one daily ritual was that Ms. Li would get
on the PA at the end of the morning announcements and give them some
"important information", which usually had something to do with
security. No one ever listened to them.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">The morning announcements
progressed as Jodie Landon read them off from the intercom room. "&#8230;and
in sports news, Old Saybrooke beat Lawndale 20-14, when a certain
Quarterback whose name I won&#8217;t mention, <i>Kevin</i>, attempted to run
the touchdown in at the last down Tommy Sherman style, despite Team
Captain Michael Jordan MacKenzie&#8217;s orders to throw the stupid ball. He
got jumped by about five guys from the other team who were expecting
it. That game would have got us into the Class-LL State Tournament
semi-finals. But I&#8217;m not bitter, <i>oh</i> no&#8230;" she abruptly broke off. "Here is Ms. Li with some final announcements."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Ms. Li&#8217;s voice came over
the PA. "Attention students, I have some exciting news! Lawndale High&#8217;s
very own Jane Lane will be getting her own exhibition room at the
Leeville Museum of Modern and Post-Modern Art one week from this
Wednesday. Congratulations to Miss Lane!"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Jane groaned, hanging her head and pinching the bridge of her nose.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"At least I&#8217;ll never have to worry about something like that," said Daria smugly.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"And another kudos to Daria Morgendorffer, who has become a semi-regular character on the critically acclaimed <i>Beavis and Butthead Show!</i> Good job to you both for bringing fame and honor to Lawwwn-dale High!"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"&#8216;Critically acclaimed&#8217;?" repeated Daria dubiously.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"I&#8217;m so proud of you, Jane!" said Ms. Defoe. "Isn&#8217;t it the dream of all artists to get their own exhibition room in a museum?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Aren&#8217;t they supposed to wait until I&#8217;m dead, first?" asked Jane, fairly certain where this was leading.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"<i>Safely</i> dead?" amended Daria.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Is something the matter?" asked Ms. Defoe.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Well, you see, I have to
recite this speech for the dedication ceremony, and I&#8217;m not too
comfortable with the idea of public speaking," Jane explained.
"Especially considering how important everyone there will be pretending
to be."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Ms. Defoe laughed. "Well
perhaps some familiar faces will help. I know what! We&#8217;ll make the
ceremony into a field trip. That way you can have your friends to
support you! How does that sound?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"It sounds&#8230;" began Jane.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Excellent! I knew you&#8217;d appreciate the offer!"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"She&#8217;s going stir-crazy, isn&#8217;t she?" quipped Daria.</font></p><p>
</p><hr noshade="noshade">
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Great! Just great!"
cried Jane after art. "Now not only do I get to make a fool of myself
in front of the art community, I get to make a fool of myself in front
of half the school!"</font><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"It&#8217;s not that bad," said
Daria. "Most of them will be too busy shooting spitballs to pay
attention to what you&#8217;re saying anyway."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"I just hope Quinn doesn&#8217;t decide to come."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Since when does she care
about painting anything other than her face?" Daria raised her
eyebrows. "Just out of curiosity, why should it matter if she <i>does</i> come?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"I&#8230; ah&#8230; may have had her a subject of a painting or two. Or three. Or four."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"I didn&#8217;t know you studied existentialism," said Daria in mock surprise. "They&#8217;re all in a negative light, I assume."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"That depends on how popular you are."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"You didn&#8217;t paint her nude, did you?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Of course not."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Damn. And I was hoping to reveal to the school how much she stuffs her bra."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">From behind them, Quinn
fought the urge to leap with joy. She had been eavesdropping from a
discreet distance from the time she had heard her name mentioned. A
painting! So what if she had been painted in black light, or whatever.
At least it wasn&#8217;t pastels. Besides, how many people in the school were
the subject of a painting? Why, she was a real life Moaning Lisa, or
whatever it was called. <i>I can&#8217;t wait to see what I look like,</i> she thought as she ran off to get a permission slip.</font></p><p>
</p><hr noshade="noshade">
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"So they&#8217;re turning this ceremony into a field trip?" asked Helen as she helped herself to another square of lasagna.</font><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Yup," replied Daria. "Now the whole art department can be offended by Jane&#8217;s work, instead of just the principal."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"God, Daria," cried Quinn. "I&#8217;m sure her paintings are nice. Can&#8217;t you at least be <i>supportive</i> of your friend for once?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"You mean the way you&#8217;re
so supportive of Sandi?" retorted Daria. "You never cared about art
before&#8230;" Daria frowned as a thought entered her head. "You eavesdropped
on our conversation, didn&#8217;t you?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Quinn shrugged. "Well,
it&#8217;s a small hallway. I couldn&#8217;t help but overhear. Come on Daria. How
often do you get to be in a painting? In fact, if she wants, I can come
over and pose for her."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"The way you&#8217;re doing now?" asked Daria snidely. "Well, she <i>has </i>said that she needs a model for her life drawing."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Jake stood up like a shot. "What? No daughter of mine is going to pose nude just for the sake of some stuck up art community!"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"She&#8217;s not posing nude for anybody, Jakey," said Helen mock sweetly. "<i>Sit down!"</i> she commanded.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Jake sat in his seat and
whimpered. "There&#8217;s a good husband," said Helen. "I think it&#8217;s a
wonderful experience to go see your friends artwork on display."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Almost like being a member of the firing squad for her execution," interrupted Daria.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Tell me, girls, do they need chaperones?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT"><i>"No!"</i> cried Daria and Quinn at once.</font></p><p>
</p><hr noshade="noshade">
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">The week passed by as
students awaited the field trip with emotions varying from anticipation
to tepidness to downright dread. Daria had managed to pass the time by
writing the speech that Jane would have to give and fending off
not-so-occult chanting of "diarrhea" worshipers. Her speech wasn&#8217;t
monumental or earth-shattering, but it was passable. Jane had approved
at least.</font><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Then the day of the field
trip arrived, and Daria went to Howard Drive to pick up Jane, as was
usual. Unlike most field trips, the departure time was at nine, as
opposed to some ungodly hour in the morning where you had to get up at
the butt-crack of dawn. Jane was bad enough at normal school hours;
getting her up at four would be like pulling Trent out of one of his
comas.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Daria walked up to the
cream colored house and rang the doorbell. Jane would be sleeping, no
doubt. If Trent didn&#8217;t answer the door, Jane would come out in her
boxers and night shirt, bleary-eyed and half asleep.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">There was a weary <i>trudge-trudge</i>
sound coming closer to the door that identified the person behind it as
Jane. It was a gift Daria had; she could identify people by their
footsteps. The footsteps faltered, and then continued toward the door.
Daria&#8217;s jaw dropped as the door opened.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Jane was dressed in a red
sleeveless rhinestone dress with a collar that hung around her neck
like a noose, leaving her barebacked. Daria craned her neck upward to
see Jane&#8217;s face. Her makeup wasn&#8217;t the usual cheap kind that jumped
loudly off of her face, but rather a softer toned type designed to
blend in with someone&#8217;s skin. Daria&#8217;s eyes slowly trailed down Jane&#8217;s
body to discover the reason why she had had to tilt her head to look at
her. She was wearing matching high-heels.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Jane&#8217;s legs began to
wobble as she tried to take a step. Daria reached out to steady her.
"Don&#8217;t say a word, Daria," she said with quiet menace. "Just don&#8217;t say
a word."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"I didn&#8217;t say anything," replied Daria mildly with a Mona Lisa smile on her face.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Good. Keep in that frame
of mind." The two started to walk to school. "Damn, it&#8217;s freezing out
here!" She put her hands underneath her armpits. "Daria, give me your
jacket."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Like hell."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"But I&#8217;m cold," whined Jane.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Then why did you get all dressed up?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"It&#8217;s my ceremony. I have to look the occasion."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Why?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Because&#8230;" she paused to
think up a good reason. "Okay, fine! I had a fit of vanity! Are you
satisfied?" She tripped again. Daria snatched her arm before she could
fall flat on her face. "Damn high heels!" Jane cursed.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"You know, Upchuck is going to have a field day with you."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Shut <i>up</i>, Daria."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"You&#8217;re in high spirits."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Call me neurotic, but something tells me that I&#8217;m going to have a bad day."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"No worse than usual."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Daria," said Jane, "you&#8217;re such an optimist."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Daria shrugged. "So everyone tells me," she replied.</font></p><p>
</p><hr noshade="noshade">
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">When Daria and Jane
finally got to school, Ms. Defoe herded them along with the rest of the
students onto one of the buses. They were greeted by a beady eyed,
middle aged woman bus driver who scowled at them.</font><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Daria sighed. "It&#8217;s finally happened. The dreaded South Park cameo."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"<i>Sit down and shut up!</i>" yelled Miss Crabtree.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">At the back of the bus, The Fashion Club conversed. "Wow, Sandi, those leggings look <i>so</i> good," said Tiffany.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"<i>I said &#8216;be quiet&#8217;!"</i> hollered Crabtree.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Actually," said Daria, "you said, &#8216;shut up.&#8217; But I guess it means the same thing."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"I&#8217;d say she rates about a nine on the DeMartino scale," quipped Jane.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">The bus swerved as
Crabtree reached for a vanilla colored box in the glove compartment.
She opened the box and took out a rabbit and a handgun. "<i>If you kids don&#8217;t shut up I&#8217;m gonna kill this little bunny!"</i> she screamed.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Oh no!" cried Quinn.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Not that!" sobbed Stacy.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Daria, on the other hand, quirked a smile. "You know, Jane, I <i>have</i> been in the mood for some rabbit stew."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"<i>Gahdammit!"</i>
screeched Crabtree. She pulled over to the side of the road and threw
the handgun and bunny down. The Fashion Club collectively breathed a
sigh of relief.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"I knew she was bluffing," said Jane.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Crabtree walked down the aisle toward Daria and Jane&#8217;s seat on the bus. She stopped two inches from Daria. "<i>All right Miss Smarty-pants!"</i> Crabtree screamed, spraying Daria&#8217;s face with flecks of spittle. "<i>You think you&#8217;re so cool just because you&#8217;re on some TV show? You spoiled little brat!"</i></font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Somewhere deep in Daria&#8217;s
brain, a fire ignited. Red lights flashed behind her eyes. It was one
thing to have to endure being called "diarrhea" or portrayed as a
little snot, but it was something else to say that she <i>enjoyed</i> it. "Let me tell you something you loudmouthed psycho!" she cried. The whole bus went silent. "You think I <i>like </i>having
someone portray me on television? You think I like things about my past
dredged up and rehashed for the entertainment of vegetables? Do you
think I like being associated with a couple of destructive idiots? <i>I hate it!"</i></font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Miss Crabtree began to
back away, but Daria continued, following her back to the drivers seat.
"No, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m cool, I just think you&#8217;re a moron! If you get so
perturbed by people talking quietly that you have to use rodent hostage
techniques, then you ought to find another job! Just how many little
elementary school kids have you traumatized over your career?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Uh&#8230; okay, sorry," said
Crabtree. She started the bus up. Daria returned to her seat, her mouth
dry and her hands shaking. Meanwhile, the kids on the bus applauded.</font></p><p>
</p><hr noshade="noshade">
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">The Leeville Museum of
Modern and Post-Modern Art was a large, H-shaped building with a nice
pastoral setting. As Daria looked at it, she wondered how such an
urban-like building could have been built in such a rural setting. The
students were herded off of the bus. Daria had to make a near save once
again as Jane nearly tripped, courtesy of her heels. "Tell me today
isn&#8217;t going to get any worse," said Jane.</font><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Today isn&#8217;t going to get any worse," said Daria.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Liar."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Daria turned and saw
another school bus pull up next to theirs, spraying Brittany with mud.
"My best cheerleading outfit!" she lamented. "That driver did that on
purpose!"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Kevin put a comforting arm around his girlfriend. "It&#8217;s all right babe."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"But I wanted to look my best for the ceremony!"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Kevin shrugged. "Don&#8217;t worry. It&#8217;s not like she&#8217;s popular or anything."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Brittany rested her head on Kevin&#8217;s shoulder. "Oh Kevvie! You think of the positive side of everything."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Kevin blushed. "Aww, babe."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"When he thinks at all,"
quipped Daria. Then she turned to the other school bus and sighed as
she saw two girls and a boy about their age step down from it. "Don&#8217;t
look now, but the intelligence shamans are here to vanquish the Demons
of Stupidity," she said to Jane.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"You read too much Dilbert," said Jane. "Why? Who are they?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Lara, Graham, and Cassidy. Those three little snots from Grove Hills I told you about."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"You mean the ones who were shallow and superficial <i>despite</i> being intelligent?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"The same. And they probably <i>did</i> splash Brittany on purpose."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Don&#8217;t worry. It&#8217;s not
like she&#8217;s a brain or anything," Jane imitated Kevin. "We can sick
Upchuck on the girls, but how do we handle Graham?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Just then, Daria spied Quinn striding confidently toward Graham. "Hi," she said. "I&#8217;m Quinn Morgendorffer. You look like you&#8217;re <i>really </i>smart.
You know, I once got an &#8216;A&#8217; on this essay about how public schools act
as a prison for gifted students. Maybe we can compare ideas."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Well I agree that public
schools can be oppressive on the intelligent. Maybe we can discuss it,"
replied Graham pretentiously. He put his arm around Quinn&#8217;s shoulders
and walked off. Quinn threw a look over her shoulders at Daria and Jane
and winked slyly at them.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Now what do you suppose <i>she&#8217;s</i> up to?" asked Jane suspiciously.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Who cares? The important thing is that she&#8217;s out of our hair for awhile," replied Daria.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Miss Defoe went up to the
Grove Hills chaperone, a man in a business suit with slicked back hair
and a pencil thin moustache. "Hello, I&#8217;m Claire Defoe, head of the Art
Department at Lawndale High School," she introduced herself.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"I represent ze Grove
Hillz Shchool vor givted shildrin," replied the chaperone in a thick
German accent. "Ve are here vor a dedicashune zeremony vor a juvenile
artiste. Ve undershtand zat she is getting her own exhibishune room. Ve
zink zat she vould make an excellent candidate vor our shchool."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Oh, you must mean Jane!" said Ms. Defoe excitedly. "That&#8217;s wonderful! She&#8217;s a student of mine."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"You must be mishtaken," said the chaperone.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Ms. Defoe frowned. Jane
knew that she was going to say something which sounded polite on the
surface, but was actually scathing. However, she never got the chance,
because Brittany decided to enter the conversation.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Oh, are you the curator?" she asked the chaperone, twirling her hair around her finger.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Vy no, Miz," answered the chaperone, uncertain how to deal with Brittany&#8217;s vapid gaze.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Ms. Defoe began to divide
her students into groups, trying hard not to laugh under her breath. In
all of her years of teaching, she never would have thought she would
appreciate Brittany&#8217;s stupidity.</font></p><p>
</p><hr noshade="noshade">
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Once inside the museum,
the two schools were led down a wide, painting-filled hall toward the
juvenile wing by an elderly curator. Daria noticed that Quinn was
keeping very close to Graham. Though she couldn&#8217;t hear what they were
saying, minute signals in Quinn&#8217;s body language, little things that
only a member of her family would recognize, gave away that she was
bored out of her skull.</font><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Psst, Daria." Daria
glanced over her shoulder and saw Danny Moreno, younger brother of
Jesse Moreno. "See that guy over with that other school?" He pointed
out the Grove Hills chaperone.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Yeah. What about him?" Daria asked.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Isn&#8217;t he the curator? He looks like one."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"I don&#8217;t think so, Danny."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Oh." Danny fell silent for a moment. "So what are you doing tonight?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Well, let&#8217;s see. I&#8217;ve
got the bake sale planned, the photo shoot for the school newspaper, my
autobiography to write, and my Montana Cabin Account to set up. So the
answer is still no."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">The group of students
turned a corner and entered the juvenile wing of the museum. The room
seemed strangely empty. "Wow," said Jane, her voice echoing. "I had no
idea how much space my stuff actually took up." They came to the end of
the corridor and into a cavernous room with walls lined with paintings
and pedestals rising from the floors with sculptures made of substances
ranging from clay to old saxophone parts. Toward the center of the
room, custodians busied themselves setting up folding chairs to face a
podium. In the background, hanging above everything else, gold metallic
letters spelled out <i>The Jane Lane Room</i>.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Daria saw Jane gazing in awe at the fantastic site. "Try not to drool all over the linoleum," she teased.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Killjoy," retorted Jane as the other students spread out to look at her works of art.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Jane smiled and began to
walk stridently toward some of the museum representatives. She got
about two steps before she stumbled as Daria steadied her again.</font></p><p>
</p><hr noshade="noshade">
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Daria and Jane followed
Lara, Graham, Cassidy, and Quinn over to a painting of a shield crest
with a castle turret in the center flanked by a brain on either side
being pierced by swords. Shark fins and human hands swam in the
turret&#8217;s moat. A drawbridge led away from the turret and had a words
"Ne Plus Ultra" written across a red banner.</font><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"&#8216;Daria&#8217;s crest,&#8217;" Cassidy read the plaque skeptically.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"How repulsive," said Lara. "A castle in the middle of all that violence. This girl must be disturbed."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"It&#8217;s like she just went
for pure gore," scoffed Graham. "No meaning whatsoever. I could get
more symbolism from a slasher movie."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Quinn struggled to say something. "I know. It&#8217;s so&#8230; <i>disgusting."  A high-walled castle with sharks and pierced brains? That&#8217;s Daria, alright.</i></font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Lara and Cassidy grunted and walked away from her. "What?" said Quinn. "Was it something I said?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Never mind them," said Graham. "They just can&#8217;t recognize your&#8230; attributes."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Even when they&#8217;re staring you in the face," muttered Daria under her breath. She knew what attributes Graham was referring to.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Jane&#8217;s arms were clenched
into fists at her sides. "&#8216;No meaning&#8217;? &#8216;No meaning&#8217;? I oughta teach
him a thing or two about art. Like how suffering builds character!"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Wait," said Daria. "I
know these type of people. After they find out who did these paintings,
they&#8217;ll want to do a little constructive ass kissing. You know what I
mean?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"You&#8217;re saying that after the speech, they&#8217;re mine?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Exactly."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Okay. Let&#8217;s go circulate around the museum staff. At least <i>they</i> appreciate me."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Daria and Jane walked toward the back of the room to find the curators and a tragic looking long-haired boy about their age.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Ooh la-la! Cute guy at high noon," said Jane, ever on the lookout for another man.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Daria adjusted her glasses. "Wait a minute. I know that guy."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Another Grove Hills brat?" asked Jane warily.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"No. He was my escort from my cousin&#8217;s wedding. I think his name was Luhrman."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"What&#8217;s he like?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"He&#8217;s sort of like Marvin the Paranoid Android meets Eeyore."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Jane smiled wickedly. "Just my type. Introduce us."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Daria and Jane walked up
to the misanthropic youth. Luhrman gave them a look of long-standing
suffering. "Yes? You&#8217;ve come, no doubt, to laugh at my rotting corpse
as it progressively decomposes before your eyes."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Jane smiled again. "We&#8217;re going to get along just fine," she said.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Daria&#8217;s deadpan sounded
perky and cheerful after listening to Luhrman. "Hi, Luhrman. You
remember me, right? Daria, from the Chambers-Danielson wedding?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Oh, yes. I haven&#8217;t been completely able to repress those memories, but I <i>am</i> seeing a therapist." He looked at Daria. "By the way, your Aunt sends her regards."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Aunt Amy?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Yes. She owns this
museum, you know. She usually lets me come in on the days when the
stupidity of my high school peers gets to be unbearable."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"I can relate to that," said Daria. "This is my friend, Jane Lane."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Pleased to meet you," said Jane, extending her hand.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"I wish I could say the same," replied Luhrman, not bothering to take it. "So, you did these paintings?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Yeah," said Jane, not knowing what else to say.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"They&#8217;re sort of pretty."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Jane cocked an eyebrow. "Oh really?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"In a deep, &#8216;life is cruel&#8217; sort of way."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Thanks," said Jane with a smile.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Uh&#8230; I think I&#8217;ll leave you two alone," said Daria and walked off to find out what everyone else was doing.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">She found Tori Jericho
along with Stacy and Tiffany by the sculptures. "Now that sculpture is
post-modern," declared Tori, "but not as post-modern as <i>that</i> sculpture. That sculpture is modern, but not <i>post-</i>modern.
That sculpture was just post-modern enough to get displayed." She
turned to Stacy with a joking grin. "You see? I can do this. I can be
an art critic." She went back to the sculptures. She pointed to a Quinn
sculpture. "That sculpture was new and cute, so it became post-modern
overnight."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Lara and Cassidy walked
up to the sculpture. Lara snorted. "Oh, please!" said Lara to Tiffany,
gesturing to the sculpture of Quinn. "These sculptures are so&#8230; banal!"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Uhh," said Tiffany.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Pure existentialism don&#8217;t you agree?" Lara asked Tiffany.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Uhh," said Tiffany.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Excuse me," said Tori coldly, walking away. Stacy meekly followed after.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Uhh," said Tiffany.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Completely
self-indulgent. How could a museum display something like that?" Lara
walked off in disgust. Cassidy looked down her nose at Tiffany, and
then followed Lara.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Thirty seconds later, Tiffany&#8217;s face lit up. "<i>Yeah!"</i> she agreed brightly. Then she looked around. "Where did everybody go?"</font></p><p>
</p><hr noshade="noshade">
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Elsewhere, Graham and
Quinn stopped in front of a painting of Quinn. The painting featured
Quinn frowning with a cog embedded in her forehead. Her normally pink
smiley-face baby-T was painted black with a frowny-face, instead. Quinn
stifled a laugh at the plaque below: "Inner Beauty". So far, the
paintings with her in it weren&#8217;t as bad as she had thought they would
be. Granted, they weren&#8217;t the most positive of messages about her to
send to others, but she doubted that any of her friends would
understand the meaning of them. In fact, if it wasn&#8217;t for Graham acting
like the stuck up little brain that he was, she might have actually
enjoyed herself. Even <i>Daria</i> wasn&#8217;t this bad.</font><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Now <i>here</i> is a
moronic painting!" said Graham. "What&#8217;s she trying to say? That
conformity is beautiful? Is she trying to say that most girls are
generic? What is that cog a symbol of? Even with my one sixty-five
I.Q., I can&#8217;t figure <i>this</i> out!"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Quinn sighed. She was sure that he had mentioned his I.Q. at least once for every point. <i>Wow! That&#8217;s still ten points lower than my sister,</i>
was what Quinn wanted to say. "Well, I think she&#8217;s saying that there&#8217;s
a lot of pressure put on young girls to be attractive and popular, and
that inside, they feel like they&#8217;re being forced into something that
they don&#8217;t want to do, almost like a machine."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"But at least she could have used an attractive girl as her subject," complained Graham.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Quinn&#8217;s jaw dropped.</font></p><p>
</p><hr noshade="noshade">
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Not far from Quinn and Graham, Tiffany rejoined Tori and Stacy at a painting of a beautiful blonde gazing into a mirror.</font><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"&#8216;Student Life at the Dawn of the New Millennium&#8217;," Tiffany read the plaque. "&#8216;Poem by Daria Morgendorffer&#8217;."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Oh, goody! A poem!" cried Stacy.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Tori read the poem.</font></p><p>
</p><center><font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT"><i>
She looks like a winner<br>
She couldn&#8217;t be thinner<br>
And now she goes to the bathroom<br>
To vomit up dinner.<br>
</i></font></center>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Ew," said Tori.</font><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Stacy&#8217;s lip began to
quiver. Her eyes started to tear up. Her whole body shook. Then she let
out a loud wail, which reverberated throughout the hall. She ran out of
the room, crying.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Now what do you suppose got into her?" mused Tori.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Lara and Cassidy came up to the painting. "Look out, Tiff!" cried Tori. "Idiot savant alert!"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Lara decided to once again try to speak to Tiffany. "You seem fairly intelligent. What&#8217;s your nationality?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"I don&#8217;t know," said Tiffany, deciding that the best way to handle a brain was to admit her stupidity and tell them to go away.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Lara, however, would not be shooed away so easily. "That&#8217;s no problem. I specialize in name origins. Tell me your last name."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Fairchild," said Tiffany, "but&#8230;"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Oh! Well, that means you&#8217;re at least half English," said Lara.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"But," continued Tiffany, "I&#8217;m adopted."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Just then Sandi Griffin,
president of The Fashion Club, came stalking toward them, with her
hands clenched at her sides. Stacy trailed behind, her makeup smeared
and her eyes red. "Listen up, you brain! You see these nails?" she held
up her hand to reveal her feminine, Freddy Krueger-like claws. "If you
don&#8217;t leave us alone, I&#8217;ll scratch your eyes out!"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Lara sniggered as she and
Cassidy walked off. "Do you think she knew I was bluffing?" asked
Sandi. Tori and Tiffany gave her a long, steady look. "Well, I <i>can&#8217;t</i> break a nail! That would be <i>so</i> geeky." Then she turned to Stacy. "I should kick you out of the Fashion Club right here! Grow up, Stacy!"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Yeah," said Tiffany. "Bulimia is <i>so</i> ninety-six."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Now, now," admonished Sandi. "I&#8217;ve agreed to overlook it this once, <i>provided</i> she quits right now."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Sure thing, Sandi," agreed Stacy.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"<i>And</i> you&#8217;re seeing
a doctor." She turned to Tiffany and Tori. "The ceremony&#8217;s about to
start, and Ms. Defoe wants us to find some seats. Come with me. I&#8217;m not
letting you out of my sight."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Yes mother," said Tori.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT"><i>"What was that?"</i> asked Sandi angrily.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Nothing," said Tori.</font></p><p>
</p><hr noshade="noshade">
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">When she had finished
looking at what her classmates were doing, Daria decided to find a
front row seat for the ceremony. Shortly after she had chosen where she
was going to sit, Luhrman joined her.</font><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Naturally, I assume you don&#8217;t want me here, but don&#8217;t worry. I won&#8217;t talk to you," he said.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"That&#8217;s a relief," deadpanned Daria with her usual sarcasm. "What did you think of Jane?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"She interesting enough.
A nice change from the brain-dead idiot blonde girls that I have to put
up with at school. It&#8217;s too bad she doesn&#8217;t like me."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Oh," said Daria. She
examined Luhrman&#8217;s shirt. "And I supposed that lipstick on your collar
is from where she tried to claw and bite at you."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Well <i>Duh</i>!" Luhrman smiled. "I thought artists were supposed to be intellectuals and thinkers."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">An emcee tapped the
microphone, causing it to emit feedback noise. "Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, distinguished colleagues, I present one of the greatest
juvenile artists in our state, Miss Jane Lane!" Polite applause echoed
through the room as Jane stepped up to the podium.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Jane cleared her throat
and took out Daria&#8217;s speech. After a long pause, she spoke. "It is with
utmost humility and gratitude that I accept this exhibition room at the
Leeville Museum of Modern and Post-Modern art. I&#8217;ve known that I was an
artist since my first coloring book." Scattered chuckles. Jane smiled
as the joke went over.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"It takes a lot of
discipline to be an artist. It&#8217;s a lot easier to just flop down and
watch TV than to go to the easel or pottery room, take up your fan
brush, and paint something that you hope will be interpreted as
meaningful&#8230;" sniggers from the Grove Hills students. "&#8230;and enjoyed in a
prestigious venue such as this one. It&#8217;s been a life long dream of mine
to receive an honor such as this.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"I&#8217;d like to thank my
teacher and mentor, Claire Defoe, for honing my skills as an artist.
Most of the lessons that I learned in her classroom were applied to the
paintings and sculptures that you see here.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"I&#8217;d also like to thank
my best friend, Daria Morgendorffer, for all of her support and ideas
for paintings. Daria is my partner in crime, and she&#8217;s an inspiration
in all of my artwork.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Most especially, I&#8217;d
like to thank this museum for allowing me to showcase my artwork. I
look forward to donating future works to this museum."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Jane put down the piece
of paper and sighed. "And last but not least, I&#8217;d like to thank my
unwitting collaborator on many of these paintings and sculptures: Miss
Quinn Morgendorffer. Quinn is one of the most photogenic girls at
Lawndale High today." Quinn stood up so that others could get a closer
look at her, as if on cue. "You may have noticed Quinn&#8217;s likeness in
most of my artwork. You can sit down, Quinn. Everyone&#8217;s done admiring
you, now." The crowd laughed and then applauded.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Jane stepped down from
the podium. As her feet touched the ground, she tripped and fell on her
face. "No good deed ever goes unpunished," she grumbled. "That&#8217;s it!
I&#8217;m sick of these heals!" She kicked off her fancy shoes. "Luhrman,
would you get me my book-bag?" Luhrman went to the back of the room and
got a black knapsack. Jane grabbed it out of his hands and unzipped it.
She fished around and drew out a pair of gray combat boots with a
sinister smirk.</font></p><p>
</p><hr noshade="noshade">
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Ten minutes later, Daria and Luhrman joined Jane by the podium. "Welcome back to the land of the eye-level," she quipped.</font><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"I can&#8217;t believe you gave me such a sappy speech," retorted Jane.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Daria shrugged. "Write it yourself next time. And why did you make such a big deal out of thanking Quinn?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"This brand of makeup tends to effect your brain," replied Jane smoothly.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Lara, Graham, and Cassidy came over. Jane grinned. The wolf was about to trap her prey.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Hello, we&#8217;re from Grove Hills school for the Gifted," began Cassidy. "We just wanted to say&#8230; you&#8217;re a genius!"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Yes, your paintings are so meaningful. It&#8217;s the best surrealism I&#8217;ve ever seen!" said Graham.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"We were wondering, would you ever consider coming to our school? I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;d make an excellent student," offered Lara.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Oh, yeah," said Jane snidely. "I could study phoniness and backstabbing."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Lara, Graham, and Cassidy exchanged looks of shock and outrage.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Why are you all
surprised? After all, isn&#8217;t that the remark you&#8217;d expect from someone
who just goes for pure gore in his or her paintings?" asked Jane with
feigned innocence. "I&#8217;d really <i>love</i> to join your school, but my
guess is that meaningless existentialists like me are a dime a dozen in
Grove Hills. You don&#8217;t need me there."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Luhrman looked at Graham.
"I&#8217;m sorry, what kind of school did you say you went to? I thought I
heard &#8216;gifted&#8217;, but that can&#8217;t be right."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">As Daria, Jane, and Luhrman walked away, Quinn came up to Graham. "Graham, would you get me a soda?" she asked.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Graham went off to the bar. "So what did you think of Jane?" asked Quinn, for want of something better to do.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"She a complete&#8230; she&#8217;s a total&#8230; she&#8217;s a&#8230;" Cassidy fought to find a word.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Bitch?" guessed Quinn.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Exactly!" cried Cassidy.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Graham came back with
Quinn&#8217;s soda. Quinn looked around to make sure no one important was
watching. When she only spied Stacy looking in her direction, she threw
the soda in Graham&#8217;s face. She wasn&#8217;t even going to <i>pretend</i> to be polite with this one.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Get this straight you
poindexter pervert. I don&#8217;t go out with guys who make fun of my
friends, or their art!" With that, she turned on her heel and marched
off to find Daria and Jane.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">She found them along with
Luhrman being accosted by Sandi. "&#8230;so, I just wanted to tell you that
if it weren&#8217;t for your painting, I wouldn&#8217;t have noticed my friend&#8217;s
problem."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Maybe if you spent less
time worrying about what you wore and more time looking out for each
other, you&#8217;d have caught it sooner," said Jane accusingly.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Hey Sandi!" said Quinn. "I thought I saw Stacy over at the buffet with this <i>huge </i>plate of food. She&#8217;s going to end up <i>bloated! Guh-ross!</i>"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"What?" cried Sandi. She stalked off toward the buffet line.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"What happened to your pet egghead?" asked Daria.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"God Daria!" cried Quinn. "You ought to know me better than to even suggest that I would fall for a <i>brain</i>. I was just playing with his head."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Jane coughed delicately. Daria sighed. "Luhrman&#8217;s giving us a ride home. Do you want to come?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Quinn smiled. "Sure," she said. "By the way, thanks for mentioning me in your speech. If you ever need me for that stuff&#8230;"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Jane snorted. "Are you kidding? You&#8217;re narcissistic enough as it is!"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Thanks," said Quinn, taking it as a compliment. She spied the Grove Hills chaperone. "Isn&#8217;t that the curator?" she asked Jane.</font></p><p>
</p><hr noshade="noshade">
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">From the passenger seat Luhrman&#8217;s car, Jane continued the conversation. "Well, so much for <i>my</i>
fifteen minutes. Aside from falling flat on my face, getting made fun
of by a bunch of investor larvae, and being put on display like a slab
of meat, it wasn&#8217;t so bad."</font><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Oh sure," said Luhrman, "Just forget me. I don&#8217;t mind."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"At least yours is over," grumbled Daria moodily.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Hey, don&#8217;t worry about it!" said Jane. "How long can a show like <i>Beavis and Butthead</i> last? Maybe five seasons?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"You&#8217;re not funny, Jane."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Sure I am. Hey, if it
makes you feel better, in the billions of people living in this world,
only about ten know you. The rest of them don&#8217;t even know you really
exist. They just think you&#8217;re some sitcom character."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Oh," exclaimed Luhrman in surprise. "You mean that girl is supposed to be you? I don&#8217;t see the similarity."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Luhrman," asked Daria with a regal smile, "how is it that you know exactly what to say to cheer me up?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Just luck, I guess," answered Luhrman sardonically.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">The car reached Jane&#8217;s house and pulled up to the driveway. "I&#8217;ll call you," said Jane as she gave Luhrman a peck on the cheek.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Thanks for noticing me," said Luhrman.</font></p><p>
</p><hr noshade="noshade">
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"So, how was your trip to the museum?" asked Helen that night at dinner.</font><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"It wasn&#8217;t that bad," said Quinn. "I mean, <i>granted</i> it was just a bunch of icky, gory paintings, <i>granted </i>that the person who was being honored wasn&#8217;t attractive and popular, and <i>granted</i> I wound up hooking up with a boring jerk who would <i>not </i>shut up, but other than that, it was okay."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"I&#8217;m sure Jane will just love to hear that you had a good time," said Daria caustically.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"I know," said Quinn genuinely.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">The phone rang.
"Hell-ooo," mooed Helen into the receiver. "&#8230;yes, she&#8217;s right here."
She handed the phone to Daria. "Daria, it&#8217;s for you."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Daria warily put the
phone to her ear and then yanked it back as a loud
"DIARRHEA-CHA-CHA-CHA," came through the receiver. It was <i>them</i>.</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Shut up, dill-hole!" said Butthead in the background. He got on the line. "Hey, Daria."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Uh&#8230; hi, Butthead," greeted Daria cautiously. What could these two possibly want?</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">In the background, Daria could hear Beavis. "C&#8217;mon Butthead, lemme talk to her!"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Use the phone in the
kitchen, you butt-monkey!" replied Butthead. "Hey Daria, we just called
to say, like, we&#8217;re sorry and stuff."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Yeah," said Beavis, now on the other line. "<i>Sorry, sorry, really sorry!"</i></font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Settle down, Beavis.
Yeah, we didn&#8217;t even want you on the show. But, like, those guys in the
suits, they wanted a brain on our show, and that&#8217;s when Beavis told
them about you."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"I did not! You told
them," shouted Beavis. "Anyway, we knew you&#8217;d be pissed, so we called
to apologize or something. Anyway, those guys are like, going to send
you a check or something. Maybe some nachos."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Daria almost laughed.
Here were the two most destructive people in Texas, if not the whole
country, and they were calling her up to apologize for offending her
sensibilities. "Thanks, Beavis."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"So Daria, wanna score?"</font></p><p>
</p><hr noshade="noshade">
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">At Pizza King, Daria bit
into a hot slice of pepperoni. "&#8230;so the network execs are giving me
license pay to use my likeness for everytime it comes on the show. But
if it turns out to be moldy Highland nachos, I&#8217;m suing."</font><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"So it turns out things
worked out after all," said Jane. "No one&#8217;s called you &#8216;Diarrhea&#8217; in
over a week, and you&#8217;ll have enough money saved up for college without
even having to go out and get a job."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Daria sighed. "Yeah."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Something wrong?"</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"I was just thinking. Why
can&#8217;t MTV put on something that all of us can relate to? I mean, just
once I&#8217;d like to turn on the television, and watch something funny,
sensitive, intelligent, and not have the characters all look like
Leonardo DiCaprio and Pamela Anderson."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"There&#8217;s a show like that on."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"And <i>not</i> have it be science-fiction."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">"Oh. Well there goes <i>Babylon 5</i>. Don&#8217;t worry," said Jane optimistically. "I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll come around."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Just then, <i>Sick, Sad World</i> came on the pizzeria&#8217;s TV set. "Coming up next, on <i>Sick, Sad World.</i> An indepth look at the new TV sensation that&#8217;s taking the nation by storm! Behind the scenes with <i>The Beavis and Butthead Show</i> after this commercial break."</font></p><p>
<font face="Book Antiqua, Goudy Old Style BT">Daria sighed, picked up her soda cup, and poured it over her pizza.</font></p><p>
