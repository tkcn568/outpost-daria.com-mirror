<P>INT. A HOUSE -- NIGHT</P>

<I><P>(We open in a bedroom, close-up on the lumpish shape beneath the blanket. There is thunder from the storm outside, and the outline of the window is cast onto the bed by lightning. The lightning flashes again, and this time we see a silhouette fall over the bed.)</P>
</I><DIR>

<P>VOICE: Young lady! I want you up this instant!</P>
</DIR>

<I><P>(The muffled voice from beneath the sheets sounds very much like Quinn.)</P>
</I><DIR>

<P>GIRL: <I>(plaintive)</I> Mother, I <I>just</I> got to bed five minutes ago. And I've got a big day tomorrow.</P>
<P>VOICE: <I>(harsh)</I> Oh? Another "big day" with that Hartwell boy?</P>
</DIR>

<I><P>(The sheets become suddenly still.)</P>
</I><DIR>

<P>GIRL: <I>(quiet)</I> What?</P>
<P>VOICE: Don't play dumb with me! I know where you were tonight! That boy is bad news, I've told you a thousand times! But no! You never listen to your mother! What do I know?</P>
</DIR>

<I><P>(The girl beneath the covers whirls around, and we see that it is a young Helen in her late teens. The speaker is, of course, Mother Barksdale.)</P>
</I><DIR>

<P>HELEN: Mother, *what* are you talking about? I was out today -- I was studying with my debate group! There's talks tomorrow at school, about the war ...</P>
<P>MRS. BARKSDALE: I know very well where you say you were! Your sister, however, was concerned for your welfare. She did the right thing coming to me.</P>
</DIR>

<I><P>(Helen's POV, we see past Mother Barksdale's arm to the doorway of her bedroom. Her sister Rita is halfway in view, a smirk just barely visible on her face.)</P>
</I><DIR>

<P>HELEN: <I>(outraged)</I> She told you WHAT? The bitch! The lying bitch! I wasn't with him <I>yesterday</I>!</P>
<P>MRS. BARKSDALE: Helen Ann Barksdale!</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=1> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=2>1</B></SUP></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> Mind your tongue! <I>(beat)</I> So you <I>were</I> with him <I>before</I> yesterday, hmm? Well young lady, we'll just see what your father has to say about this!</P>
</DIR>

<I><P>(Furiously, Helen scrambles out of bed and pushes past her mother.)</P>
</I><DIR>

<P>MRS. BARKSDALE: <I>(irate)</I> Don't you DARE treat me in this manner! I am your MOTHER! You march right downstairs --</P>
</DIR>

<I><P>(Helen slams the door in her mother's face, leaving her inside the bedroom. She sees Rita at the foot of the stairs and flies at her.)</P>
</I><DIR>

<P>HELEN: YOU!</P>
</DIR>

<I><P>(Rita grins, and steps back. Up the stairs, Mother Barksdale is carrying on furiously. Helen is about to launch herself at Rita, when ...)</P>
</I><DIR>

<P>MR. BARKSDALE: <I>(offscreen; from the living room)</I> What's all that damn noise!</P>
</DIR>

<I><P>(Helen looks from the living room entrance, to up the stairs, and then at a smirking Rita. Tearing herself away, she flees to the outside door. It is raining outside, and she is almost immediately soaked. She splashes across the porch to the ground and dodges around to huddle beside it, hidden from view.)</P>
</I><DIR>

<P>VOICE: So ... how's the weather, sis?</P>
</DIR>

<I><P>(Helen looks up. A younger Amy is looking down on her from her higher, drier vantage point on the veranda. She's smirking.)</P>
</I><DIR>

<P>AMY: You four at it again?</P>
<P>HELEN: Leave me alone!</P>
<P>AMY: You know, if you stop competing with Rita she'll stop tormenting you.</P>
<P>HELEN: Oh what do you know? It wasn't even true!</P>
<P>AMY: You mean you <I>weren't</I> seeing Brent Hartwell?</P>
<P>HELEN: Yes! Of course I was! But not tonight!</P>
<P>AMY: So what does that matter?</P>
<P>HELEN: <I>(sniffling)</I> What's the matter? RITA is the matter! It's not even so bad that she spoils my dates or gets me in trouble with Mom or Dad. I can get her back for that! <I>(quivering with anger and frustration)</I> She could have told Mom it was last week. I still would have gotten in trouble. She would have had her fun. But no! She says "tonight" and Mom <I>believes</I> her! She <I>always</I> believes Rita over me! Always "momma's little girl!" "Nothing but the best for my *darling* little Rita! She knows it, and she lied to Mom just to lord it over me!</P>
<P>AMY: <I>(tough-luck sympathy)</I> Look, Helen. Let me give you some advice. Forget what Mom says. Forget what Mom thinks. It's not worth it.</P>
<P>HELEN: And let that ... that <I>bitch</I> win?</P>
<P>AMY: It's not a competition, Helen. Face it. Rita's the sycophant. Rita's the prettiest. Ergo, Mom likes Rita best. It's not fair, but we have to live with it.</P>
</DIR>

<I><P>(This is a rare show of empathy from Amy, and an equally rare opportunity for Helen to form a bond with her sister, but Helen misses it completely. Instead, she lashes out defensively.)</P>
</I><DIR>

<P>HELEN: <I>(irate)</I> Shut up! It's not true!</P>
</DIR>

<I><P>(We hear the door to the house swing open.)</P>
</I><DIR>

<P>MRS. BARKSDALE: <I>(offscreen)</I> Helen Barksdale! Get back in here! Amy! Where is your sister!</P>
</DIR>

<I><P>(Without turning, Amy glances down at Helen before speaking.)</P>
</I><DIR>

<P>HELEN: <I>(whispering)</I> Don't lie for me.</P>
<P>AMY: <I>(complying with Helen's wishes)</I> She's hiding. She thinks you're playing favorites.</P>
<P>MRS. BARKSDALE: <I>(dismissive)</I> Nonsense. <I>(shouting)</I> HELEN ANN BARKSDALE! Get back here right now and apologize to your sister!</P>
</DIR>

<I><P>(This is the last straw. Helen runs out into full view, rain streaming over her face and nightgown, as she makes her stand.)</P>
</I><DIR>

<P>HELEN: I <I>won't</I> apologize, Mother! I won't demean myself in front of that lying bitch! I don't care what you think! Do you hear? I DON'T CARE! You can HAVE Rita! I don't need you! I'll make something of myself without you! Just watch me do it, Mother! WATCH ME!!! I DON'T NEED YOU AND I'LL PROVE IT! DO YOU HEAR ME, <I>MOTHER??? I'LL PROVE IT!!!!!</P>

<P>INT. MORGENDORFFER RESIDENCE -- NIGHT</P>

<I><P>(Another bed, another shape, turning, muttering. Pan back to show it is Helen, tossing about in the depths of a strong nightmare. Jake is awake next to her, shaking her gently.)</P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(not sure she's awake)</I> Wha ... Jake? Oh, Jake!</P>
</DIR>

<I><P>(Helen clutches Jake close, exhausted. Jake's predictable reaction is temporary discomfort. Still, ever the dutiful husband, he manages a comforting smile and pats her on the back.)</P>
</I><DIR>

<P>JAKE. There, there. It was only a bad dream, Honey. You just tell Jakey all about it. Was it the one where we're celebrities, and our lives get spread out all over the internet? Was that the one?</P>
</DIR>

<I><P>(Helen has regained her faculties by this point. With a sigh of disgust, she pushes away from Jake.)</P>
</I><DIR>

<P>JAKE. <I>(confused)</I> What? Was that the <I>good</I> dream?</P>
<P>HELEN: <I>(sarcastic)</I> Celebrities, Jake? Does that <I>sound</I> good?</P>
</DIR>

<I><P>(At this point, Jake, exercising his nonexistent ability to detect sarcasm, decides that Helen is "in the mood.")</P>
</I><DIR>

<P>HELEN: And that goes for Rita too!</P>
<P>JAKE. <I>(out of ideas)</I> Oh.</P>

<P>INT. MORGENDORFFER KITCHEN -- EARLY MORNING</P>

<I><P>(Helen, in her robe (she’s up early, so she hasn’t dressed for work yet,) enters the kitchen. To her surprise, Daria has beat her up, and is sitting at the table eating breakfast. Dawn is shining its first light into the room. Helen walks straight to the coffee-maker.)</P>
</I><DIR>

<P>HELEN: Good morning, Daria.</P>
<P>DARIA: <I>(mouth full)</I> Mmph.</P>
</DIR>

<I><P>(As she passes the table, she does a double-take. Daria is eating pizza.)</P>
</I><DIR>

<P>HELEN: <I>(starting the coffee)</I> Daria, is that leftover pizza?</P>
<P>DARIA: <I>(swallowing)</I> Pizza is a nutritious breakfast food. High in carbohydrates and protein. And a good caloric boost.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=1> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=2>4</P>
</B></SUP></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><P>HELEN: Didn’t you reheat it?</P>
<P>DARIA: It’s better cold. And it’s a lot better for you than that coffee. Have a slice.</P>
<P>HELEN: <I>(distaste)</I> Umm ... No thanks, Daria.</P>
</DIR>

<I><P>(Daria shrugs and returns to her meal.)</P>
<DIR>

</I><P>DARIA: What are you doing up so early, anyway.</P>
<P>HELEN: Oh, I couldn’t sleep. What about you, sweetie, aren’t you up awfully early?</P>
<P>DARIA: I woke up with a great short story idea. But I’m too tired to write, and I don’t want to fall back asleep and forget it. So I decided on an early breakfast.</P>
<P>HELEN: <I>(interested) </I>That’s great, honey, what are you writing about?</P>
<P>DARIA: Since when are <I>you</I> interested in what I write?</P>
<P>HELEN: <I>(taken aback)</I> Daria, do I need to justify it? I’m your mother! Now come on, what is it?</P>
<P>DARIA: Well ... since you asked so nicely, it’s a scathing portrayal of a young man whose hopes and dreams are destroyed by the crushing realization that he can never live up to his expectations in a world where hypocrisy is valued above merit.</P>
<P>HELEN: <I>(disappointed)</I> Oh, Daria. That’s sounds so ... so depressing.</P>
<P>DARIA: It is. So is most fiction.</P>
<P>HELEN: Daria ...</P>
<P>DARIA: Don’t worry. I’m not suicidal. This is just designed to get a rise out of Mr. O’Neill. I made the mistake of allowing some subtle optimism to creep into my latest essay, and he’s been going on about how much my attitude has improved.</P>
<P>HELEN: <I>(reluctant) </I>That sounds like him. Just ... just be careful, Daria.</P>
<P>DARIA: <I>(flat)</I> Sure.</P>

<P>EXT. LAWNDALE HIGH -- DAY</P>
<P>INT. MR. O’NEILL’S CLASS</P>

<I><P>(The Junior class is in their usual positions, wearing their usual expressions. Mr. O’Neill is standing at the chalkboard, upon which is written &quot;Melville,&quot; &quot;Ahab,&quot; &quot;Starbuck,&quot; and &quot;Typee.&quot;)</P>
</I><DIR>

<P>O’NEILL: Now before we finish today, who can give me some characteristics of Herman Melville’s writing? Kevin?</P>
<P>KEVIN: Umm ... lots of big words?</P>
<P>O’NEILL: Yes, Kevin! Very good! Lots of big words. <I>(optimistic)</I> Brittany?</P>
<P>BRITTANY: Animals? Like that whale!</P>
<P>O’NEILL: <I>(optimism fading)</I> Um ... no, Brittany. I’m looking for <I>writing</I> characteristics. <I>(scanning the faces)</I> Daria?<I> (of course)</P>
</I><P>DARIA: <I>(sighs)</I> Melville utilizes semicolons and extensive use of preposition to extend his sentence structure. He also phrases words with an ironic or comical meaning.</P>
<P>O’NEILL: <I>Very</I> good, Daria.</P>
</DIR>

<I><P>(The bell rings.)</P>
</I><DIR>

<P>O’NEILL: Don’t forget, class! Up to page 400 of <I>Moby Dick</I> by Monday! <I>(among assorted groans, he approaches Daria before she can leave.)</I> Daria, I was wondering if you’d stay after class for a moment.</P>
<P>DARIA: <I>(looking around; Jane has bailed out)</I> I guess. Why?</P>
<P>O’NEILL: I want to talk to you about your writing.</P>
<P>DARIA: Look, Mr. O’Neill, we’ve been through this before. I’m not going to sell out.</P>
<P>O’NEILL: <I>(protesting)</I> That’s not it at all, Daria! I would never ask you to do that! Just the opposite! I want to encourage you to <I>buy in</I>.</P>
<P>DARIA: Excuse me?</P>
<P>O’NEILL: Daria, have you ever thought about your career after High School?</P>
<P>DARIA: <I>(caught off-guard)</I> Umm ... I suppose so.</P>
<P>O’NEILL: You want to be a writer, right?</P>
<P>DARIA: It’s come up.</P>
<P>O’NEILL: Excellent! Now have you thought about getting published?</P>
</DIR>

<I><P>(Daria’s unbalanced expression indicates she hasn’t.)</P>
</I><DIR>

<P>O’NEILL: <I>(continuing)</I> Oh, I know you’ve had a few ... <I>(chuckles nervously)</I> things printed in the school newspaper. But have you considered submitting an article to the town newspaper? Or one of our local magazines perhaps. Many publishing companies accept short story submissions.</P>
<P>DARIA: I ... I suppose I’d never given it much thought.</P>
<P>O’NEILL: <I>(encouraging)</I> Think about it. There’ll never be a better time to start trying! The sooner you break in to the field the better! Start climbing now -- get in at the ground floor!</P>
<P>DARIA: You’re mixing metaphors.</P>
<P>O’NEILL: I ... oh. Yes. <I>(chuckles)</I> Well, just remember, Daria. I’m here to help.</P>

<P>INT. HELEN’S OFFICE</P>

<I><P>(Helen stands behind her desk, phone in one hand, pen in the other, a stack of documents occupying her attention. Marianne bustles back and forth. Her attention split three or four ways, it is difficult to tell who exactly Helen is speaking to at any given moment.)</P>
</I><DIR>

<P>HELEN: I don’t care <I>what</I> his excuse is, I need that background information, and I need it by this afternoon ... would you excuse me for one second? -- Marianne! Coffee! Now! -- Now where were we? ... MmmHmm ... Absolutely not! You know Reinhardt, he’ll string us up by our heels! Oh damn! What? No, not that, this document needs Eric’s signature, and -- Eric!</P>
</DIR>

<I><P>(Helen has noticed that her boss, Eric Shrecter is standing next to her desk. Marianne rushes up to the desk with Helen’s coffee. Assuming it’s for him, Eric takes the cup and Marianne rushes off.)</P>
</I><DIR>

<P>HELEN: Frank, I’ll call you back. <I>(closes cellphone; calling after Marianne)</I> Marianne, that coffee! <I>(to Eric) </I>Eric, thank <I>God</I> you’re here. Can you sign these immediately?</P>
<P>ERIC: I’m taking you off the McDonel case.</P>
<P>HELEN: <I>(startled)</I> What?</P>
<P>ERIC: I have a bigger assignment for you. You’re being put in charge of the Holmes case.</P>
<P>HELEN: But what about ...</P>
<P>ERIC: Horowitz will handle it. <I>(steps forward seriously) </I>I’m going to be frank, Helen. The Holmes case is high profile. As prosecuting attorney, this kind of case is a big step towards becoming a full partner. As a matter of fact, Mr. Holmes is a close personal friend of Rick Vitale. But Rick won’t represent him because the defense could make a solid case for personal bias. He specifically requested you. You’ve earned yourself quite a reputation these past few years, and we have every confidence in you.</P>
</DIR>

<I><P>(Helen is momentarily speechless. Abruptly, her ambitions of the past decade have become suddenly, tangibly real. Eric waits a few moments as he sips his coffee.)</P>
</I><DIR>

<P>ERIC: Well do you think you can handle it?</P>
<P>HELEN: <I>(emphatically)</I> Yes! <I>(toned down slightly)</I> Yes, Eric. Of course. I’ll get right on it.</P>
<P>ERIC: Excellent. We’ve got a meeting in an hour with Mr. and Mrs. Holmes in 3C.</P>
</DIR>

<I><P>(At this point, Marianne arrives with a fresh cup of coffee. Eric takes it, hands her his now-empty mug, and exits. Helen is galvanized into action, folding up the papers on her desk.)</P>
</I><DIR>

<P>HELEN: Marianne, get these materials to Horowitz fast, and get me all the information on the Holmes case. And coffee! <I>Try</I> to get it to <I>me</I> this time.</P>
</DIR>

<I><P>(Marianne offers a breathless apology, seizes the documents and is gone in a flash. Helen sinks into her desk chair, a smile forming.)</P>

<P>TOM: Don’t jump the gun there! I’m still intruding on your time with Jane.</P>
<P>DARIA: Thanks for reminding me.</P>
<P>JANE: We were just scheming. We’re trying to figure out the best way to get Daria published.</P>
<P>DARIA: It’s not something I’d given much thought until now. Realistically, anyway. I mean, I write for myself. It’s what I do. But I don’t know if I can make a living off it. I’m afraid I might be forced to start writing for <I>other</I> people, and that’s a compromise I don’t think I could live with.</P>
<P>TOM: Even if it meant putting bread on the table?</P>
<P>DARIA: I don’t know. It’d have to be <I>really</I> good bread.</P>
<P>TOM: Why don’t you ask Jane?</P>
<P>JANE: Yeah. Ask me about my gallery exhibitions.</P>
<P>DARIA: Your gallery exhibitions?</P>
<P>JANE: Yeah, I’ve had a few pieces circulated in local ... well, circles. With Ms. Defoe’s help, of course. You don’t think I get <I>all</I> my money from Mom and Dad.</P>

<P>TOM: Oops. Are you saying I knew something about you that Daria didn’t?</P>
<P>JANE: Umm ... <I>(to Daria)</I> Well it’s not like you ever asked.</P>
<P>DARIA: <I>(faux bitter) </I>So how long before the Smithsonian comes beating down your door?</P>
<P>JANE: Oh, I think that’s jumping the gun. I have sent out submissions to quite a few magazines, though.</P>
<P>DARIA: And?</P>
<P>JANE: And in return I’ve received several nice letters. <I>(beat)</I> Aaand some not-so-nice ones. <I>(beat)</I> Look, Daria, frankly I’m as stupefied by the whole thing as you are. The last thing I want to end up doing is &quot;graphic design.&quot; I want to play by my own rules, no compromises. Trent’s the same way.</P>
<P>DARIA: But even Trent’s broadened his art to encompass TV commercials, remember?</P>
<P>JANE: Yeah. And if I <I>have</I> to paint houses between masterpieces, I’ll do it. The whole &quot;starving artist&quot; bit doesn’t appeal to me.</P>
<P>DARIA: <I>(long sigh)</I> The idealist versus the realist.</P>
<P>TOM: <I>(sympathetic)</I> It’s a fine line to walk. But I wouldn’t worry too much about it just yet. That’s what college is for. What you <I>can</I> do in the meantime is try to get something published on your own terms. <I>(beat)</I> How about this. For the sake of objectivity, Jane can make up a list of all the different media you can possibly write for, and after school you can pick one.</P>
<P>JANE: Oh sure. Put the burden on me. And how about you?</P>
<P>TOM: <I>(grandly)</I> <I>I</I> ... will drive you home after school and drop you off.</P>
<P>DARIA: Ah-ha. Don’t worry, you’ll be able to stick around. I plan on getting some good writing in this afternoon. You two’ll just have to think of some way to occupy yourselves without me.</P>
<P>JANE: <I>(somberly)</I> And poor Trent will be so lonely ...</P>

<P>ANTHONY: <I>(extends a hand)</I> A pleasure, Helen. This is my wife Shirley.</P>
<P>SHIRLEY: Pleased to meet you.</P>
<P>HELEN: Likewise.</P>
<P>ERIC: I assume you’ve familiarized yourself with the case, Helen?</P>
<P>HELEN: <I>(professional)</I> I certainly have. The two of you are suing Lana Morrill for the kidnapping of your young daughter Christine for a period of three weeks. I haven’t had time to properly go over the defense documents, but it looks like the facts of the case are pretty clear cut. The challenge will be swaying the jury. And I understand the defense will be drumming up something on the basis of relation?</P>
<P>ANTHONY: Lana is our daughter.</P>
<P>HELEN: I beg your pardon? Your <I>daughter</I> kidnapped your <I>other</I> daughter?</P>
<P>SHIRLEY: For three weeks. Christine was only five.</P>
<P>ANTHONY: Lana’s twenty-two. A real bad apple. Married once, divorced ... no kids of her own. The police apprehended her in Colorado. We want damages, plus legal expenses, and a restraining order. I don’t want her <I>near</I> our little girl.</P>
<P>HELEN: I see. Well ... I’ll have to put my assistant on getting the necessary information, and ... <I>(glances at Mr. Vitale)</I> We’ll have statements ready by tomorrow, of course.</P>
<P>RICK. That’ll be fine, Helen. Excellent work. <I>(Helen beams.) </I>Now let’s talk witnesses...</P>

<B><P>ACT 2.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P>INT. LANE RESIDENCE -- JANE’S ROOM</P>

<I><P>(Daria is lying flat on one side of the bed. Trent sits on the other end with his guitar, humming chords to himself and largely oblivious. Jane is sitting on the foot of the bed, holding her list, and Tom is sprawled over a nearby chair, listening.)</P>
</I><DIR>

<P>JANE: Okay, we’ve nixed &quot;graffiti,&quot; &quot;informational brochures&quot; and &quot;public service announcements.&quot;</P>
<P>DARIA: It’s that whole good Samaritan thing ...</P>
<P>JANE: Right. Next up, &quot;novel.&quot;</P>
<P>DARIA: Someday. But first I’d have to write one. And besides ... book publishers like you to have a few other publications under your belt. My age and lack of experience is going to hurt me if I try to jump right in.</P>
<P>JANE: Okay. &quot;Short story compilation.&quot;</P>
<P>DARIA: Again, I’d probably have to submit to a larger company’s compilation. And there are no literary magazines in Lawndale. I’d have to research that one.</P>
<P>JANE: &quot;Internet fan fiction.&quot;</P>
<P>DARIA: Nnno.</P>
<P>JANE: Aww, c’mon, why not?</P>
<P>DARIA: For one thing, I’d have to be a fan of something. For another, the internet is not a good venue for publication. Anyone can do it, and it’s hard to authenticate. And third, fan fiction is a waste of time. It’s just an excuse for people who aren’t creative enough to come up with their own ideas, but want to pretend they’re writers.</P>
<P>TOM: Ouch. That’s pretty harsh, Daria. Couldn’t you say that it’s a good challenge and a healthy creative outlet? That it allows the author to refine and hone certain skills, not the least of which is writing to a discriminating audience?</P>
<P>DARIA: Yes ... you could say that. You could <I>also</I> say <I>our</I> lives were interesting enough to write about.</P>
<P>TOM: Ah. I see your point.</P>
<P>JANE: Okay, fan fiction is out. Next up, &quot;article&quot; -- newspaper or magazine.</P>
<P>DARIA: <I>(pause)</I> This one doesn’t sound too bad. For one, it’s short, and non-fiction is more palatable to the general public. It’ll allow me to make a statement. And since it’s appropriate for newspaper or magazine publication, I’ll have lots of opportunities for submission.</P>
<P>JANE: Well I’m glad you like it. <I>(beat)</I> Because barring &quot;major motion picture,&quot; my list just ran out.</P>
<P>TOM: Perfect timing.</P>
<P>DARIA: Great. Now I can enjoy a week of sleepless nights.</P>
<P>JANE: Trouble with insomnia?</P>
<P>DARIA: When I get on a writing binge, I can’t seem to shut my brain off.</P>
<P>JANE: <I>(nods)</I> Trent’s the same way.</P>
<P>TRENT:<I> (perking up at his name) </I>Huh?</P>

<P>MR. LANE: ... I <I>told</I> him coffee beans weren’t candy, but he wouldn’t listen.</P>
<P>AMANDA LANE: Is there anything you can do for him, doctor? He just won’t sleep. We’re beginning to get concerned.</P>
<P>MR. LANE: Don’t worry, dear. I’ve seen them hypnotize wild beasts in Africa! It’s very effective.</P>
<P>HYPNOTIST: I can assure you, hypnotism is perfectly safe, and I think you’ll find the results are extraordinary. <I>(to Trent)</I> Now what’s your name, young man?</P>
<P>TRENT: Trent.</P>
</DIR>

<I><P>(The hypnotist opens his briefcase, and removes a flat disc with a swirl design on it. There is a device attached, and the disc begins to spin. The hypnotist holds it up in front of Trent.)</P>

<P>HYPNOTIST: Alright, Trent. I want you to look at this here ... that’s right ... now relax. Let your mind wander. <I>(long pause)</I> Can you hear me, Trent?</P>
<P>TRENT: Yes.</P>
<P>HYPNOTIST: Okay, Trent. Now I want you to think of a word, Trent. The first word that pops into your head.</P>
<P>TRENT: <I>(staring deep into the spiral)</I> Spiral.</P>
<P>HYPNOTIST: Okay, great. &quot;Spiral.&quot; Now Trent? Whenever you want to go to sleep, just call up the word &quot;spiral&quot; and you won’t have any trouble. Got it?</P>
<P>TRENT: Yes.</P>
<P>HYPNOTIST: Okay. Now when I turn this off, you’ll be asleep, okay?</P>

<P>MR. LANE: We certainly will.</P>

</I><DIR>

<P>HELEN: Daria! Great news!</P>
<P>DARIA: They’ve finally come up with a diet cola that tastes more like regular cola?</P>
<P>HELEN: <I>(ignoring the sarcasm)</I> I just landed a very high profile case! It’s a major career-booster! You may be looking at the next partner in the firm of Vitale, Davis, Horowitz, Riordan, Schrecter, Schrecter and Schrecter.</P>
<P>DARIA: <I>(deadpan)</I> Throw another shrimp on the barbie.</P>
<P>HELEN: <I>(put-off)</I> You know, Daria, this is a major event for me. You might show a little more enthusiasm.</P>
<P>DARIA: Oh. I’m sorry. Here, let me drum up some. <I>(beat; monotone) </I>Yippee.</P>
<P>HELEN: <I>(sighs)</I> You know, it wouldn’t kill you to feign happiness for just a minute.</P>
<P>DARIA: It’s insincere.</P>
<P>HELEN: No, it’s polite. I’m not going to make you care about me, Daria, but assuming you do, it’s <I>insincere</I> to deliberately avoid supporting the people you love.</P>
</DIR>

<I><P>(When there is no reaction from Daria, Helen peers over her shoulder.)</P>
</I><DIR>

<P>HELEN: Is this that short story you’re writing?</P>
<P>DARIA: I don’t know. Is that <I>sincere</I> interest, or just your parent’s handbook talking?</P>
<P>HELEN: <I>(giving up)</I> Oh, fine, Daria! Shut me out completely. I’m only your mother. Maybe your father has something intelligent to say.</P>

<P>QUINN: Yeah. You know women are <I>never</I> going to assert themselves in the workplace looking like <I>that</I>. <I>(She holds up an image of a female judge.)</I> I mean, white collar with <I>black</I>? She looks like some sort of priest!</P>
<P>HELEN: <I>(not in the mood to challenge)</I> Quinn ... do you think I’m a good mother?</P>
<P>QUINN: Huh? Oh ... sure. I mean, you buy me stuff and you haven’t lost the house yet. Of course, my allowance could be a <I>teensy</I> bit more ... how shall I say it? &quot;Large.&quot; And you’re a bit hyper-critical about school, and <I>then</I> there’s the whole issue of curfew ...</P>

<P>QUINN: Don’t be silly! Of <I>course</I> you’re adequate! I mean, look at Sandi’s mom.</P>
<P>HELEN: <I>(under her breath)</I> Linda. Don’t remind me.</P>
<P>QUINN: <I>(returning to the magazine)</I> You worry too much, Mom. <I>(calling to the living room) </I>Daria, what’s &quot;jurisprudence&quot; mean?</P>

<P>INT. MORGENDORFFER RESIDENCE -- MASTER BEDROOM -- THAT NIGHT</P>

<I><P>(Jake and Helen are in bed, going about their usual business -- in other words, Jake is reading his omnipresent newspaper while Helen is going over legal papers. Helen is obviously having trouble concentrating, and she puts down her pen, sets the papers aside and turns to her husband.)</P>
</I><DIR>

<P>HELEN: Jake, do you ever worry about the girls?</P>
<P>JAKE: <I>(half-listening)</I> Sure, honey. All the time.</P>
<P>HELEN: Jake! Listen to me! <I>(Jake tunes in) </I>I’m afraid we’re not connecting anymore. I told Daria the good news about my job today, and she practically shot me down completely. I don’t worry about Quinn so much ... it’s just Daria is so sensitive to real life. I’m afraid we may be alienating her. And I don’t want to see the kind of gap develop that formed between me and <I>my</I> mother.</P>
<P>JAKE: <I>(seriously)</I> We have a good kid. I think we can trust her to make the right life choices. If anything goes wrong, it’s not your fault.</P>
</DIR>

<I><P>(Helen is startled by this out-of-character advice from Jake. Narrowing her eyes, she pulls down his newspaper to reveal a pamphlet labeled &quot;Bedroom Psychology -- What She Wants To Hear.&quot;)</P>

</I><P>HELEN: <I>(angry)</I> Jake, would you <I>put</I> that thing away? I want to talk to <I>you</I>, not some ridiculous &quot;wife-guide.&quot;</P>
<P>JAKE: <I>(dejected)</I> But it sounds so good ...</P>
<P>HELEN: Try to understand what I’m saying, Jake. I’m afraid Daria doesn’t <I>need</I> me anymore. That I’ve lost my usefulness to her. I mean, I try so hard not to be the kind of parent <I>my</I> mother was, always controlling and playing favorites. I try to give our girls every opportunity to find themselves and their potential. But sometimes I wonder if I haven’t given them too much freedom. So much that they don’t respect me anymore, only what I can do for them, and when that’s gone ... it’s my own mother all over again. What do you think, Jake?</P>

<I><P>(If you have a copy of the &quot;Daria Diaries&quot; -- and chances are if you’re reading this you probably do </I>-- <I>get it out and flip to the map of Lawndale. The courthouse looks like it’s near number eighteen. Ironically, it’s closer to Morgendorffer Home Base than the High School.)</P>
</I>
<I><P>(Helen and Eric are sitting at the table for the Prosecution with Mr. and Mrs. Holmes. The Council for the Defense consists of a court-appointed male litigant. The jury is typically average, displaying a fair amount of boredom as they await the judge. Lana Morrill, the plaintiff, is a depressed-looking young lady with stringy blond hair. A female bailiff enters the room.)</P>
</I><DIR>

<P>BAILIFF: All rise. Court is now in session. Case of Holmes versus Morrill. The Honorable Judge Michael Foster presiding.</P>
</DIR>

<I><P>(Judge Foster enters the room. He is a relatively young judge, with dark hair and glasses not unlike Daria’s. He has the same flat stare, as well.)</P>
</I><DIR>

<P>HELEN: <I>(whispering to Eric as things start off)</I> He’s awfully young, isn’t he?</P>
<P>ERIC: And progressive, which means he’s more likely to side with the defendant. You’ve got your work cut out for you. It’s time for opening statements.</P>
</DIR>

<I><P>(Helen rises to address the court.)</P>
</I><DIR>

<P>HELEN: Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. I’ll be brief, as is appropriate to the facts of the case. We intend to show, beyond a doubt, that the defendant willfully and maliciously abducted her younger sister, endangering her well-being for a period of three weeks, and putting her parents through a trial that no parent should have to endure. We are confident that in a case where the evidence is so overwhelming, justice will certainly prevail.</P>
</DIR>

<I><P>(Several members of the jury appear to be parents, because they nod sympathetically. Helen seats herself, smiling as Eric and the Holmes’ nod appreciatively. Helen looks behind her to catch a thumbs up from Rick Vitale, who is in the general seating. The Counsel for the Defense rises.)</P>
</I><DIR>

<P>COUNSEL: Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. What we are dealing with here is not a matter of kidnapping. It is a matter of <I>rescuing</I>. We intend to prove to you that not only were Ms. Morrill’s actions justified, they were both prudent and necessary. This is an unfortunate family crisis, and one that no <I>child</I> <I>(he looks pointedly at Helen)</I> should have to endure.</P>

<P>LI: <I>(cutting him off; waving Daria’s paper)</I> Ms. Morgendorffer, this is a flagrant attack on the Criminal Justice system! You can’t <I>honestly</I> expect Lawndale High to endorse it?</P>
<P>DARIA: <I>(still scowling)</I> It was Mr. O’Neill’s idea.</P>
<P>LI: That you attempt to get published, yes. Your academic record is outstanding here; a source of pride and tremendous honor -- a credit to your education here <I>(Daria snorts)</I> ... and we are more than happy to encourage your career, to bring publicity and positive reflections on <I>Lllllawndale</I> High. But <I>this</I> ... <I>(she smacks Daria’s paper against the desk for emphasis)</I> ... is not the sort of left-wing subterfuge we can stand behind.</P>
<P>DARIA: You’re missing the point. There’s no partisan message.

<P>MR. HOLMES: That is correct.</P>
<P>HELEN: Nor did you voluntarily allow her onto the premises that night?</P>
<P>MR. HOLMES: I made it clear to her that she was not welcome in our home, and that I would take court action against her if she ever tried. <I>(beat)</I> Which she has, and more.</P>

<P>ANTHONY: Why the <I>hell</I> did you let her go on for that long?</P>
<P>HELEN: <I>(blinks)</I> It <I>was</I> her testimony.</P>
<P>RICK: <I>(soothing)</I> Now, Anthony, we knew this might come up. It’s not Helen’s fault. Don’t you worry. Helen’s one of the best we have. We’ll be sure to discredit Lana. Her past isn’t exactly spotless.</P>
<P>HELEN: <I>(narrowing her eyes)</I> Mr. Holmes, is there something you haven’t told me? Because if there is, I need to be prepared for it, or I can’t be expected to perform adequate prosecution!</P>
</DIR>

<I><P>(Anthony just scowls. Rick leans over, and says quietly:)</P>
</I><DIR>

<P>RICK: Fifteen years ago, Anthony was charged with child abuse. </P>
<P>HELEN: <I>(shocked) What?</P>
</I><P>RICK: It was never proven, and the time for appeals has long since expired. But it’s the kind of thing that’ll hit hard with the jury. Now I don’t know why we got this recess, but I suggest you spend the rest of the day figuring out the best way to discredit the defendant as quickly as possible.</P>
<P>HELEN: <I>(demanding)</I> Was the charge true?</P>

<P>HELEN: No? And you want me to <I>discredit</I> her?</P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(suddenly unsure)</I> No! No. I mean ... that’s not what I’m saying. It’s just ... <I>(long breath)</I> I know this is important. I’m ... I’m a mother myself, you know, two girls ...</P>

You don’t understand, I know the <I>Lawndale Insider </I>is a magazine about politics ... the angle is fine where it is, if you change the focus you miss the point ... I said <I>no</I>!

<P>HELEN: What’s wrong?</P>
<P>DARIA: <I>(angry)</I> Do you really want to know?</P>
<P>HELEN: Of course.</P>
<P>DARIA: Fine. I wrote an article about how screwed up the judicial system is. I’m trying to get it published. But every newspaper or magazine I go to either doesn’t take me seriously or wants me to sell out, and I’m not going to do it.</P>
<P>HELEN: You can’t let that get you down, Daria.</P>
<P>DARIA: Oh sure, easy for you to say. You don’t get it, do you Mom? This isn’t just some experiment for me. We’re talking about my future career. How can I expect to make a living this way? How will this change or get better? It won’t!</P>

</I><DIR>

<P>HELEN: Listen to me, Daria. I know this means a lot to you. But you have to be prepared for this sort of thing, sweetie. You can’t deny you have a very ... abrasive personality. If you want to be taken seriously, sometimes you have to make a compromise.</P>
<P>DARIA: <I>(bitterly)</I> Yeah, you’re the master at that, aren’t you?</P>
<P>HELEN:<I> (taken aback)</I> What?</P>
<P>DARIA: <I>(angry) </I>Your whole job is compromise, isn’t it? You completely submerge your own scruples so you can give someone who doesn’t deserve it a fair trial. Your job description is to win by any means necessary, and you’re <I>proud</I> of it. How can you talk to me about <I>selling out</I>? You <I>define</I> it.</P>
<P>HELEN: <I>(scandalized)</I> <I>Daria</I>!</P>
<P>DARIA: I don’t need your help, or your advice! I’m more than capable of dealing with this without you. So if you’ll excuse me ...</P>

<I><P>(Daria promptly gets up and leaves, going up the stairs, where we hear a door shut. Helen is too shocked for words, and she remains silent on the couch, staring into space, her worst fears realized. We hear Daria’s words reverberate in her mind, splicing together: &quot;I don’t need your help&quot; ... &quot;don’t need your advice&quot; ... &quot;without you&quot; ... &quot;without you&quot; ... &quot;I don’t need you.&quot; Abruptly, she tears herself upright and dashes up the stairs.)</P>

<P>JAKE: <I>(alarmed)</I> Helen?</P>
<P>HELEN: <I>(choking back a sob)</I> Oh Jake ... I just had the most terrible ... Daria blew up at me. And I think of Mother, I’m <I>her</I> Jake, I tried so hard, but I’m <I>her</I>! And our girls are paying for it.</P>

</I><DIR>

<P>JAKE: <I>(calming voice)</I> Helen, you can’t live in the past! You need to learn from your parents’ mistakes, but you can’t let them dominate you. It’s the only way to grow beyond them.</P>
</DIR>

<I><P>(Helen isn’t stupid. She realizes that this is completely out-of-character advice from a man who needs it more than she does. And she sees the marriage pamphlet poking out from two leaves of the paper, despite Jake’s attempts to conceal it. But the look on his face is so sincere ...)</P>
</I><DIR>

<P>HELEN: <I>(softly) </I>You’re really trying, aren’t you Jake?</P>
<P>JAKE: <I>(doesn’t quite catch it)</I> Huh?</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(still sour)</I> I answer to that name, yes.</P>
<P>JAKE: <I>(comes fully into the room)</I> I’d like to talk to you ... about your mother.</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(looking back for the first time)</I> Like <I>Mom</I>? How can you say that?</P>
<P>JAKE: <I>(seriously) </I>You know, Daria, she’s not a sell-out. She got into law because she believed in the <I>truth</I>. Just like you do. I mean, the counterculture was great and all -- changed my life -- but it had run out of steam. She wanted to make a difference. <I>(pause; Jake frowns to himself)</I> If anything, <I>I’m</I> the sell-out.</P>

<P>COUNSEL: Ms. Morrill wants her parents to drop the charges. In return, she won’t bring up the issue of child abuse. She’ll agree to cease any actions that could be considered harassment, and in return her parents will have to agree to submit to a series of evaluations to affirm that they are acting as fit parents for Christine. If they do this, she’ll agree not to prosecute. We feel it’ll be better for the family that way.</P>

<P>HELEN: They did.</P>
<P>FOSTER: Mrs. Morgendorffer, that would appear to support the defense.</P>

<P>BALDWIN: Hello?</P>
<P>DARIA: Mr. Baldwin? Hi. Um ... you may not remember me. This is Daria Morgendorffer.</P>
<P>BALDWIN: Daria, of course, how could I forget? What can I do for you?</P>
<P>DARIA: Actually, I was hoping for some advice. The other day, Mr. O’Neill started talking about my future ... what I’d do after High School, that sort of thing. So I decided to try and get something published. I wrote this article about the judicial system ...</P>
<P>BALDWIN: Wait, let me guess ... the content is scaring off publishers? Your age getting you in trouble? Your lack of previous experience?</P>
<P>DARIA: <I>(miserably)</I> All of the above.</P>
<P>BALDWIN: MmmHmm. I thought that might be the case.</P>
<P>DARIA: So do you have any advice?</P>
<P>BALDWIN: This sort of thing isn’t uncommon. Although I must admit, most enterprising upcoming writers aren’t quite as ... rigid as you are.</P>
<P>DARIA: I’m <I>not</I> going to compromise.</P>
<P>BALDWIN: And I don’t recommend you do. Not exactly, anyway. But sometimes, Daria, you have to give a little to get a little. Like it or not, you <I>have</I> to deal with publishers if you want to get published ... and a lot of them are jerks. That doesn’t mean you should be less honest ... just tone it down a little. Trust me. That’ll give you a lot more freedom in the future. And that’s what counts, isn’t it?</P>
<P>DARIA: <I>(pause)</I> I’ve heard similar talk these last few days.</P>
<P>BALDWIN: It’s good advice. True, it would be nice if everyone was intelligent and sensible. Of course ... then what would you write about?</P>
<P>DARIA: Mm.</P>
<P>BALDWIN: Listen, if you’re asking for help, I have a few connections. I’ll make a few phone calls ... see if I can find anybody willing to listen. But you realize I can’t guarantee anything. And if not, don’t worry. It’s not a mark of failure yet. Most people don’t get published until college or beyond.</P>
<P>DARIA: Um ... that’s good to know?</P>
<P>BALDWIN: <I>(smiling)</I> Good-bye for now. I’ll get back to you if something develops. Don’t let it get you down, Daria. I’d hate to see such a promising talent go to waste.</P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(thinks she’s talking about her business suit)</I> Well it’s not <I>perfect</I>, Mom. If you want, I could have the Fashion Club evaluate your wardrobe. Not that Sandi would know.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">2. Gates McFadden. See the casting of the fictional &quot;Daria: The Movie&quot; to get this.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">3. &quot;Jakeish&quot; ... hmm ... I’ve invented a word! You have my permission to use it. Royalties pending.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">4. I was eating pizza for breakfast when I wrote this. It’s all true! Pizza <I>is</I> a good breakfast food! And it’s better cold.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">5. My first inclusion of Tom! I’m just assuming he’s a year or two out of High School, making him older than Jane but younger than Trent. That’s also why he hasn’t met Daria or Jane yet. I suspect the show will prove me right. Anyway, I’m giving him a test-drive, so to speak. Surprisingly enough, he’s both fun to write for and integrates smoothly. A key part of keeping a show like Daria going for as long as it proposes to is coming up with new and interesting dynamics. We’ll see what the &quot;professionals&quot; do with him.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">6. My mom -- along with most women I know -- <I>loves</I> these things! I don’t know why! So I guess I’m pioneering a new female stereotype here. A subsection of  &quot;women love chocolate.&quot; (Umm ... I better hope my female readers enjoy <I>Mars Bars</I>. No, Diane! Put the ’maters down!)</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">7. It happened in C.E. Forman’s &quot;To Helen Back.&quot; Go read it! Also, my earlier mention of Judge Reinhardt is a tip o’ the hat to this excellent fic.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">8. Confession time. I have no idea how hypnotism works. If I turn out being wrong and this is completely bogus, here’s my loophole: the Lane’s hired a bogus hypnotist, and that’s why Trent can’t control it. There. Instant redemption! :)</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">9. As seen in <I>every</I> episode of &quot;Daria.&quot; It’s the paper Daria’s reading during the opening credits. Silly me, I had to <I>ask</I> to get this information!</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">10. As detailed in C.E. Forman’s &quot;A Morgendorffer Scorned,&quot; one of my personal favorite works of fan fiction, as it deals with Daria the emerging writer. A superb read.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">11. Eugene Baldwin, from the aforementioned &quot;A Morgendorffer Scorned,&quot; appears courtesy of C.E. Forman.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="LEFT">AUTHOR’S NOTES:</P>
</B><P ALIGN="LEFT"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Okay, first off this was REALLY HARD TO WRITE! I mean <I>really</I> hard! Stuff like this takes stamina! For one, there was the decision to do a Helen-centric fic, with <I>Daria</I> as the subplot. But this is an example of a subplot being crucial to the main plot, as opposed to a diversion or a secondary theme. I’m trying to chart Daria’s fledgling career even as I chart Helen’s maturing one.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">And that means law-talk! I know next to <I>nothing</I> about law, except what I recall from High-School. God knows, I tried to be accurate, and to keep it as simple as possible. Brushing it aside would have been a mistake, as her career is an essential part of Helen. I tried to keep the court scenes short and succinct  -- and hopefully interesting. My greatest fear was turning this into an episode of &quot;Law and Order.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Again, examining the family dynamic, Helen and Daria are really the key players. Quinn and Jake have more passive roles. (Okay, Jake and Quinn aren’t always &quot;passive&quot; per se. So I tried to give them an appropriate inclusion.)</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Anyway, this was a surefire toughie. It had me wishing I could quit every few lines. But the story kept demanding to be told. Like the good little slave I am, I told it. I’d like to imagine &quot;eloquence&quot; and &quot;pathos,&quot; but, subjective as I am, I can’t differentiate such qualities from &quot;hackneyed&quot; and &quot;cliche.&quot; Nothing for it, then, but to loose fingers to keyboard and let you, the reader, be the judge. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you don’t get the title of this fic, it’s a reference to the famous farce by French author Molliere &quot;A Doctor in Spite of Himself.&quot; A hilarious comedy. Go check it out from your local library.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Special thanks to C.E. Forman for allowing me to use the character of Eugene Baldwin. I hope his brief portrayal in this story meets with C.E.’s approval.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">As always, anyone who wishes to has my permission to download or post this story at their leisure, as long as content remains unchanged. And as always, feel more than free to e-mail me about this fic at *DELETED*   Thanks for making it this far!</P></FONT></BODY>
